  "Ingredients": "['1 cup dry or 1 (12-ounce) can pigeon peas, pinto beans, or black-eyed peas', '2 cups long-grain rice', '3 tablespoons canola oil', '3/4 cup sugar (white or brown)', '1 (3-pound) chicken, cut into 8 pieces, skin removed', '1 small onion, chopped', '1 clove garlic, finely chopped', '1 cup coconut milk', '1 bay leaf', '2 teaspoons Green Seasoning', '1/2 cup chopped parsley', '1 sprig thyme', '2 carrots, peeled and chopped', '5 scallions, chopped (white and green parts)', 'Kosher salt', '2 cups cubed fresh calabaza or butternut squash', '1 small whole Scotch bonnet pepper', '1/2 cup ketchup', '1 tablespoon butter']",
  "Instructions": "If using dried peas, soak them overnight in 3 cups of water. Drain. Bring 3 fresh cups of water to a boil in a saucepan and add the peas. Simmer for 15 minutes, or until cooked almost completely through. Drain and set aside. If using canned beans, drain, rinse with cold water, drain again, and set aside. Wash the rice by placing it in a colander or fine-mesh sieve and running cold water over it until the water runs clear, about 1 minute. Drain well and set aside.\r\nHeat the oil over medium heat in a Dutch oven or other heavy, deep pot. Add the sugar and swirl in the pot, stirring constantly; allow it to caramelize to a dark brown color. Add the chicken and stir well to coat. Add the onion and garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly.\r\nStir in 2 cups of water, the coconut milk, bay leaf, Green Seasoning, parsley, thyme, carrots, and scallions. Season with salt. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.\r\nStir the rice, squash, peas, hot pepper, ketchup, and butter into the chicken. Cover and cook for 20 minutes, or until the peas and vegetables are tender. Remove lid and fluff the rice. The rice should be moist but not sticky. Remove bay leaf, thyme sprig, and hot pepper.\r\nNote: Pigeon peas are traditional in this dish, but pinto beans or black-eyes peas also work well because, like pigeon peas, they hold their shape well after cooking. Brown sugar is preferable for deeper flavor and color. Chicken is the most common meat in pelau, but cuts of stew beef or lamb work just as well. If using meat, up the cooking time before adding the rice to 40 minutes to allow the meat to get tender. In Tobago, pelau is often made with crab. West Indian pumpkin (also called calabaza) is ideal for this recipe, although the pie or \"cheese\" pumpkin common in the U.S., if in season, makes a very good substitute. Butternut squash will also work, although it will be slightly less sweet.",

  "Title": "Creole Cream Cheesecake With Caramel-Apple Topping",
  "Ingredients": "['2 cups graham cracker crumbs (about 16 whole crackers)', '3 tablespoons granulated sugar', '3 tablespoons firmly packed light brown sugar', '1⁄4 teaspoon kosher salt', '1⁄2 cup unsalted butter, melted', '2 pounds cream cheese, at room temperature', '1 cup granulated sugar', '1⅓ cups Creole Cream Cheese', '1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste', '2 eggs, at room temperature', 'Ingredient Info: You can substitute 1 cup sour cream mixed with 1⁄4 cup buttermilk for the 1⅓ cups Creole Cream Cheese.', '3¾ tablespoons unsalted butter', '3⁄4 cup granulated sugar', '1⁄4 cup firmly packed light brown sugar', '1½ tablespoons honey', '4 cups peeled, cored, and evenly chopped Granny Smith apples (about 7)', '1½ teaspoons finely grated lemon zest', '1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice', '3⁄4 teaspoon kosher salt', '3⁄4 teaspoon ground cinnamon', '1⁄3 teaspoon ground cardamom', '1⁄3 teaspoon ground ginger', '1 teaspoon vanilla extract']",
  "Instructions": "Make the crust. Preheat the oven to 375°F. In a medium bowl, stir together the graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, and butter to combine. Pat the mixture into a 10-inch springform pan, pressing the crumbs firmly in an even layer on the bottom and making sure they come at least halfway up the side of the pan. Bake for 7 to 10 minutes, until the crust is fragrant, dry, and toasty. Let cool, then wrap the entire outside of the pan tightly in two layers of foil, all the way to the top.\r\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large bowl using a handheld mixer, cream the plain cream cheese and sugar on medium-high speed for about 4 minutes, until incredibly smooth and light. Stop the mixer and scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the Creole Cream Cheese and vanilla paste and beat on medium-high speed for about 2 minutes, scraping down the bowl once more. Decrease the speed to medium and beat in the eggs, one at a time, incorporating each one before adding the next. Mix just until the batter is smooth and uniform. Continuing to mix past that point, even though the batter won’t look different, only incorporates extra air, which will cause the cheesecake to bubble excessively and the surface to crack as that air tries to escape during the baking process.\r\nDecrease the oven temperature to 350°F. Pour the batter into the prepared crust and tap the pan gently on the counter a few times to remove any large air bubbles. Place the springform pan in a large baking or roasting pan (just big enough for the springform pan to fit in) and set the pan on the middle rack in the oven. Fill the pan with enough hot water to reach the rim of the springform pan. Bake for about 1 hour, or until the sides of the custard are set and the middle is still just slightly wobbly. Generally, if the entirety of the custard is fully set, your cheesecake is overbaked. Don’t panic—it’ll still be delicious, and you’ll do better next time!\r\nLet the cheesecake cool in the water until it is about room temperature. (You don’t want to have to try to grab the pan out of hot water if you can help it.) However, if you’re worried that your cheesecake might be slightly overbaked, you’ll want to pull it out rather quickly, and let it cool at room temperature. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before slicing. The cake can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 4 days.\r\nIn a large heavy-bottomed sauté pan, heat the butter until melted. Stir in the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and honey and let cook until bubbling. Add the apples and toss to coat. Stir in the lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, cinnamon, cardamom, and ginger; stir to combine. Cook for about 4 minutes, or until the apples just start to soften. Remove from the heat, stir in the vanilla, and transfer to a bowl to cool completely before use. The filling can be made up to 3 days ahead of time and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator.",

  "Ingredients": "['2¼ tsp. nonfat dry milk powder', '2 tsp. baking powder', '2 tsp. granulated sugar or light brown sugar', '2 cups (240 g) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting', '1 Tbsp. vegetable oil, plus more', '2 Tbsp. vegetable shortening, room temperature', '1 Tbsp. ghee, unsalted butter, or vegan butter, room temperature']",
  "Instructions": "Whisk milk powder, baking powder, granulated sugar, and 2 cups (240 g) flour in a large shallow bowl. Add about a fourth of ¾ cup warm water (110°) and mix in a wide circular motion with your fingers to gently combine (do not knead). As mixture becomes dry, add more of the water, little by little, and keep mixing gently until a shaggy dough forms; it should be soft and sticky, without dry spots. (Depending on the humidity, you may not need all of the water.)\r\nDrizzle 1 Tbsp. oil over dough and gently press with your knuckles so that the top of dough is covered with oil. Cover bowl with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rest in a warm spot 15 minutes.\r\nMeanwhile, mix shortening and ghee in a small bowl until smooth.\r\nTurn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. Flour your hands and gently fold dough over on itself once or twice, then roll into a fat cylinder. Working quickly, without handling the dough too much, divide dough into four equal pieces and gently form each piece into a ball. Cover balls with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rest 10 minutes.\r\nRoll out a dough ball on a lightly floured surface into a 5-6\"–diameter round. Brush with a quarter of shortening mixture and sprinkle evenly with flour. Cut a slit halfway across the dough, from the center to the edge. Starting on one side of slit, fold cut edge of dough at about a ¾\" interval. Continue folding process until you reach the other side of the slit and have formed a cone. Pinch together edges at wide end of cone to seal, then bring both point ends together at the top and gently push in toward center of cone to create a dimple (you don’t need to push in too far). Push point at narrow end of cone in toward the center. You should now have a ball with a dimple on each end. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and repeat with remaining balls of dough. Cover balls with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rest 20 minutes.\r\nHeat a tawa or griddle over medium until a drop of water immediately sizzles on surface, about 2 minutes.\r\nMeanwhile, place a ball of dough on a dimpled side on a lightly floured surface. Gently flatten into a round with your hands, turning once if desired, then roll, rotating often, to a ⅛\"-thick round, about 10–12\".\r\nBrush tawa with a thin layer of oil. Cook roti until it begins to bubble slightly across the surface, about 20 seconds. Brush surface of roti with oil and continue to cook until bubbles across surface increase and roti is stiff enough on bottom side to turn, about 1 minute more. Turn roti over and brush surface with oil (bubbles may deflate; that’s okay). Using a spatula, move roti around to avoid hot spots and ensure even cooking, pressing on edges and uncooked spots to increase contact with pan. Continue to cook, turning every 30 seconds or so, until cooked through and both sides are speckled with golden brown spots, 1–2 minutes more. Using 2 spatulas, push opposite edges of roti toward the center. Smack down on the bunched roti with the ends of the spatulas to break up and flake, then turn roti over. Repeat process, scrunching and smacking roti from different directions, until flaky and lightly shredded. Transfer to a clean kitchen towel set inside a bowl or basket and wrap up to keep warm. Repeat with remaining dough balls and more oil, adding finished roti to bowl and covering tightly with towel as you go.",

  "Ingredients": "['1½ cups warm water', '1 teaspoon instant yeast', '4½ cups (540 grams) bread flour, divided, plus more as needed', '2 tablespoons canola oil, plus more for your bowl', '3½ teaspoons Morton kosher salt']",
  "Instructions": "Combine the water and yeast in a large mixing bowl (if you have a stand mixer, use that bowl) and let sit for 5 minutes.\r\nReserve ½ cup (60 grams) bread flour and add the remaining 4 cups to the mixing bowl along with the canola oil.\r\nIf you have a stand mixer, fit it with the dough hook and knead the mixture on low speed for about 3 minutes, until a sticky but cohesive dough starts to form. Pause occasionally to scrape down the bowl if the flour is clinging to the sides and bottom or climbing up the hook. If you’re making the dough without a stand mixer, mix it with a wooden spoon. In either case, loosely cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a dish towel and let rest for 30 minutes.\r\nWith your stand mixer on low or while stirring by hand in the mixing bowl, add the salt and, over the course of 2 or 3 minutes, add the remaining ½ cup flour, 2 tablespoons at a time. The dough should be more tense; it will feel soft but tacky, although it will pull from the sides of the bowl.\r\nFlour your hands generously and use them to pull the dough onto a clean, unfloured work surface. Cup your hands around the dough, rolling it in short, circular strokes and using the sides of your hands to nudge it into a relatively smooth ball.\r\nLightly wipe the inside of a large bowl with canola oil and place the dough inside, flipping it once or twice to coat. Loosely cover the bowl and let the dough rise at a warm room temperature for 1 hour.\r\nAfter 1 hour, the dough will be stretchy but very soft. Leaving it inside the bowl, stretch opposite sides of the dough over the center. Rotate the bowl a quarter- turn and stretch the dough in the same way, then flip the whole mound of dough upside down and cover again. Let rise for 1 hour.\r\nRepeat this series of folds one more time, allow it to rise at room temperature for 1 hour, then tightly cover the bowl and refrigerate overnight or up to 2 days. The longer the dough is refrigerated, the more flavor it will have. After this rise, it’s ready to be shaped; bear in mind that, once it’s shaped, it will need more time for a final rise, so plan ahead.\r\nWipe a bit of canola oil on a large baking sheet. Dump the dough onto a clean, dry counter, and use a bench scraper or sharp knife to cut it into eight equal pieces; make clean, decisive cuts rather than use a sawing motion, so you don’t deflate all the air inside.\r\nLightly flour your hands and place one palm directly over the dough ball, with all your fingertips touching the counter to make a sort of “cage” around the dough. Roll it in brisk, small circles on the countertop so it tightens itself into a smoother, more taut ball.\r\nSpace the rounds of dough a few inches apart, seam side down, on the sheet, and roll to coat them lightly in oil. Tightly cover the sheet with plastic wrap so the dough doesn’t dry out, and let them rise at room temperature for 2 to 4 more hours, until they’re pillowy.\r\nMeanwhile, set a baking stone on the center rack of your oven and turn on the broiler. You’re emulating a 700°F wood- burning oven, so you need to give the stone a good long while to preheat before you bake.\r\nWhen the dough is ready, lightly flour a work surface, and use a bench scraper or thin metal spatula to coax one piece into your palm; be sure you don’t manhandle it or you’ll force out the pockets of air that formed while it rose. Dust a little more flour on the top of the dough and onto your rolling pin.\r\nWith firm, even pressure, briskly roll the dough a few times along its length. Flip it upside down, rotate it a quarter- turn, and roll it the same way, keeping it as round as possible. Repeat, dusting a little extra flour as needed, until it’s about 6 inches across.\r\nThis next part happens fast and furiously, so make sure you have no distractions—screaming children and natural disasters will have to wait. Use tongs or a good oven mitt to pull the oven rack with the baking stone partially out. Carefully pick up the pita, drape it over your palm, and slap it down onto the stone as if you’re giving it a high- five (just be careful not to touch the hot stone!). Set a timer for 1 minute, and close the oven. Broilers vary in strength but all are quite hot, so don’t turn your back on the oven or the pita may burn. Check on it— it should puff up and build in color, with some beautiful blistered spots. If it’s still pale, close the oven and let it keep baking for 30- second intervals.\r\nUse tongs to flip the pita, and let it finish baking with the oven door cracked so you can watch it finish. Pull it out when the second side is as pretty as the first; this can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes, depending on your broiler.\r\nBake off the rest of the dough this way; as you get the hang of it, feel free to bake two pitas at a time. Serve these hot or at room temperature.",

  "Instructions": "To make the “beet water,” roughly chop 2 pounds of the beets (select the smaller ones), preferably in a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Place the chopped beets in a large stockpot. Add 10 cups of water and 1 tablespoon vinegar.\r\nPlace the stockpot over high heat and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 2 hours. (If it seems like the liquid is evaporating too quickly, you may need to cover the pot partially with an offset lid.) The beets should be extremely soft and the liquid bright red.\r\nStrain the liquid, pressing the cooked beets against the side of the strainer to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the pulp or reserve. Set aside the beet water. You should have just about 4 cups.\r\nMeanwhile, place the remaining 1 pound of whole beets in a separate large stockpot. Add water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the beets are tender-firm, about 40 minutes. When the beets are cooked, add 1 tablespoon white vinegar and set them aside to cool.\r\nWhen the whole cooked beets are cool enough to handle, peel them; the skins should slip off easily. Grate the peeled beets on the largest holes of a box grater or in a food processor fitted with the grating blade.\r\nTo make the broth, place the pork butt in a large stockpot and add the beef stock. If necessary, add a little more stock or water to cover. Add the bay leaf, allspice berries, and peppercorns. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the meat is tender and beginning to fall apart, about 2 hours. Set the pork aside to cool. When the pork is cool enough to handle, remove it from the pot and cut the meat into ½-inch cubes. Strain the broth and discard the bay leaf, allspice berries, and peppercorns. Reserve the cubed meat and 4 cups of the broth.\r\nTo cook the vegetables, place the carrots and celery in a large stockpot and pour the reserved meat broth over them. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until the carrots and celery are just tender, about 8 minutes. Add the cabbage and potatoes and continue to cook until the potatoes and carrots are easily pierced with a pairing knife but keep their shape, 15 to 20 additional minutes. Add the lima beans and cook for 5 additional minutes, just to meld the flavors. Gradually add the remaining 7 tablespoons white vinegar, tasting between additions and stopping when the flavor is to your liking. Remove the soup from the heat and set aside.\r\nTo compose the soup, in a large soup pot combine the “beet water” and meat broth with the vegetables. Add the cubed pork and the grated beets. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer over low heat. Season to taste with salt and serve immediately.",

  "Instructions": "Using a sharp chef’s knife, score skin of each fish fillet in a crosshatch pattern, making cuts about ½\" apart. Season fillets on both sides with salt and alligator pepper.\r\nToast cubeb peppers in a dry small skillet over medium-low heat, shaking occasionally, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a spice mill or mortar and pestle. Let cool and coarsely grind; set aside. Coarsely chop half of papaya into 1\" pieces; set remaining half aside. Coarsely chop half of cilantro (leaves and stems); set remaining cilantro aside.\r\nTransfer chopped papaya to a blender; add oil and blend, adding 1–2 Tbsp. water to get it going if needed, until smooth.

Blend mixture to a smooth paste.\r\nCoat fillets all over with marinade, rubbing into score marks. Place fish, skin side down, in a single layer in a large baking dish. Squeeze juice from half a lemon over. Set remaining lemon half aside for serving. Cover with plastic wrap or a lid and chill at least 2 hours and up to 12 hours.\r\nFill a large bowl with water. Peel yams and slice in half lengthwise, then slice in half crosswise. Cut each quarter into ½\"-thick slabs. (Length of slabs will depend on yam’s size, but you’re going for something that looks like steak fries.) Add yam slices to bowl as you work to prevent oxidation. When all yams are cut, swish in water to remove excess starch, then drain. Refill bowl and repeat process until water is clear, about 2 more times. Add sugar and ½ tsp. salt and stir until dissolved; add the drained chips. (Yams, like many foods that are good for you, can be quite bitter; the sugar will help counter this.) Let soak 30 minutes.\r\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 450°. Drain chips and pat dry with a clean kitchen towel. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with 2 Tbsp. oil. Season with black pepper, then sprinkle with chili powder and remaining 1 tsp. salt. Toss to coat, then spread out into an even layer. Roast chips, turning halfway through, until golden brown and crisp, about 20 minutes.\r\nHeat broiler. Scrape off excess marinade from fish and place fillets, skin side up, on another rimmed baking sheet. Broil until browned and crisp on top and cooked through, 5–7 minutes.\r\nUsing a vegetable peeler, shave reserved papaya into ribbons, pick leaves from reserved cilantro stems, and cut reserved lemon half into wedges.\r\nTransfer fish to plates and top with papaya and cilantro.

  "Instructions": "Place apricots in a small bowl and pour in hot water to cover. Let sit 20 minutes, then drain and coarsely chop. Return apricots to same bowl and add rum; stir to coat. Chill at least 30 minutes and up to 1 day. Drain into a mesh sieve set over another small bowl or container. Reserve apricots and rum separately.\r\nMelt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat.

Transfer to a spice mill or mortar and pestle and let cool. Grind as well as you can. The grains of selim won’t completely break up, so cracked open but mostly whole is okay—you just want to release some of their flavor.\r\nHeat oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Cook white and red onions, stirring occasionally, until softened and just starting brown, 20–25 minutes. Stir in ground grains of selim and cubeb pepper, garlic, ginger, and remaining 1 tsp. coconut sugar. Cook, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes.

Add drunk apricots along with any syrup and cook, stirring often, about 2 minutes.\r\nAdd tomato purée to pot and cook, stirring occasionally, 4 minutes, then stir in chile powder. Add broth and fresh chile. Cover pot and cook, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until a loose dark brown paste forms, 30–40 minutes. The oil will rise to the surface when the sauce is ready. Remove from heat; taste and season with more salt if needed. If you like texture, leave as is, or blend with an immersion blender (or let it cool slightly and blend it in a blender) to make it smooth. Let cool completely.\r\nSpoon shito into jars or an airtight container with at least a ¼\" layer of oil on top.\r\nDo ahead: Shito can made 1 week ahead. Cover and chill.\r\nNote: The amount of chile described in this recipe is what I would classify as pretty hot—some West Africans might call this medium hot, some very hot. Folks familiar with heat will enjoy this, but if you don’t like super-jacked heat you should probably err on the lower end of the range.

  "Title": "Summer Bean Soup With Tomato Brown Butter",
  "Ingredients": "['8 oz. (230 g) dried beans, such as flageolet or navy, or fresh shelling beans', '2 in. square dried kombu', '2 large tomatoes', '2 celery ribs', '1 carrot', '1 leek, white and light green parts only', '6 shallots, skins intact', '6 garlic cloves, minced', '4 oil-packed anchovy fillets', '6 Tbsp. (90 ml) extra-virgin olive oil', '2 Tbsp. maple syrup', '1 ½ Tbsp. kosher salt', '1 Tbsp. red pepper flakes', '1 tsp. whole-grain mustard', '8 oz. (230 g) bacon', '8 oz. (230 g) Romano beans or green beans, chopped into 1 in. pieces', '2 shallots, thinly sliced', '1 tsp. red pepper flakes', 'Zest and juice of 1 lemon', '1 garlic clove, grated', '12 pickled green beans (see Basic Wet Salt Method, below)', '9 cherry tomatoes, quartered', '2 tsp. extra-virgin olive oil', '1 tsp. sherry vinegar', 'Tomato Brown Butter', 'Crumbled feta, parsley leaves, and marjoram leaves for garnish']",
  "Instructions": "Combine the dried beans and kombu in a large container and cover with plenty of water to soak for at least 4 hours or overnight; skip this step if using fresh beans.\r\nDrain the beans and kombu and add them to a large pot with enough water to cover by about 1 in. (if using fresh beans, add the kombu now). Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; meanwhile, halve the tomatoes and cut the celery, carrot, and leek into about 3 in. pieces. As soon as the water boils, decrease the heat to medium-low and add the vegetables to the pot, along with the whole shallots and minced garlic. Continue to cook at a gentle simmer until the beans are very creamy, 60 to 90 minutes for dried beans and about half that for fresh.\r\nRemove the pot from the heat and use a slotted spoon to reserve the tomatoes; remove and discard the other vegetables.\r\nSet up a sieve over a heat proof container and strain the beans (there should be about 3 cups or 480 g), reserving all the cooking liquid.\r\nIn a blender, combine 1 cup (160 g) of the cooked beans with 2 cups (480 ml) of the cooking liquid, plus the tomatoes, anchovies, oil, maple syrup, salt, red pepper flakes, and mustard. Purée until extremely smooth, pour into a large bowl, and fold in the reserved cooked beans by hand. At this point, you can serve it right away or transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days, gently rewarming over medium-low heat when you’re ready to serve.\r\nWhile the bean soup is cooking, preheat the oven to 325°F. Cut the bacon into ¼ in. lardons; reserve 3 whole beans for garnish and cut the rest into 2 to 3 in. pieces.\r\nIn a medium saucepan or Dutch oven, spread the bacon in an even layer and cook over medium-low heat until it starts to turn golden and crisp, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the pieces but leave the fat behind.\r\nIncrease the heat slightly, and sauté the shallots until translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in the chopped beans, bacon, and red pepper flakes. Cover with a lid or a tight layer of foil and bake until the beans are very soft, 60 to 90 minutes. Stir in the lemon zest, juice, and garlic as soon as the beans come out of the oven and cover again; the residual steam will cook the garlic.\r\nThinly slice the pickled green beans on the bias. Combine with the cherry tomatoes, oil, and vinegar.\r\nTo serve, ladle the bean soup into bowls with a big spoonful of the baked beans on top. Garnish with the pickled green bean mix, a swirl of tomato brown butter, crumbled feta, and torn fresh herbs. Leftovers can all be refrigerated in separate airtight containers, though the green bean salad is best on the day it’s made, when the beans are most crisp and the tomatoes are fresh.\r\nThis works for any amount of dense vegetables or dense, underripe fruit, either whole or cut up, such as carrots, turnips, beets, winter squash, onions, green beans, Brussels sprouts, green tomatoes, small apples, underripe peaches, and whole baby cabbages. Peel off any tough skins, such as on beets, winter squash, and onions, and trim the tops. Leave the vegetables whole or cut them into the desired finished shape. Place the vegetables in a nonreactive container and pour water to completely submerge them; as you do so, keep track of how much water you’re adding since the amount of water will dictate the amount of salt (generally 3.5 percent salt by weight of the water for most vegetables, although cucumbers can handle 4 to 5 percent and the increased salt assists with keeping their texture crispy). With a long wooden spoon, stir kosher salt into the brine (or add the salt, cap the jar, and give it a hearty shake) until the salt is dissolved. Place a weight on top of the vegetables to keep them submerged in the brine. Seal the container, using a lid with an airlock if you have one. If you don’t have an airlock, you’ll just need to open the container every few days or so to release carbon dioxide buildup and check for mold. Place the container in a clean, low-light area with an ambient temperature of 60°F to 68°F until the pickles taste sour, about 3 weeks. Refrigerate indefinitely.",

Stir in the smooth tomato purée (be careful; it might spatter) and simmer for another minute or so. You’re looking to slightly cook the purée but keep its brightness. The mix won’t emulsify, which is fine. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.",

Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until it is foaming vigorously and smells like caramel, about 3 minutes.\r\nImmediately pour honey mixture over peanut butter in reserved bowl (it will melt the peanut butter). Stir to combine, making sure to aggressively break up any clumps.\r\nUsing a fork or small whisk, lightly beat egg white in a small bowl to thin out. Add to oat mixture and mix until egg white is no longer visible.\r\nScrape oat mixture into prepared pan and press firmly into an even layer. (Be sure to really compact the mixture into the pan—it helps to use the bottom of a heavy glass or metal measuring cup.)\r\nBake granola bars until deep golden brown and no longer sticky or wet, 30-35 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes, then lightly score into 16 long rectangles (1 cut lengthwise and 7 cuts crosswise will make bars that are about 6½x1\"). Let cool completely in pan, then use parchment to hoist bars out onto a cutting board. Using a sharp chef’s knife, cut along marks to separate bars.\r\nDo Ahead: Bars can be made 1 week ahead.

Cover and chill.\r\nRinse lentils, then soak in 2 cups water at room temperature at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours. (Soaking the lentils makes them tender and a lot easier to blend.)\r\nMeanwhile, trim ends of zucchini and cut crosswise into 3 pieces about 2\" long. Cut each piece lengthwise into ¼\"-thick planks.

Heat ghee in a medium cast-iron skillet over medium-high until a pinch of batter added to the pan sizzles and sputters. Using a large spoon, scoop out about ¼ cup batter, then use a second large spoon dipped in the hot ghee to carefully scrape into pan; flatten with ghee-coated spoon. Repeat to make 3 more fritters. Fry until deep golden brown underneath, about 3 minutes. Turn over with a wide slotted spatula and fry until deep golden brown on the second side, about 3 minutes. Transfer fritters to prepared rack to drain; season immediately with salt. Repeat with remaining batter (you end up with 8–10 fritters total).\r\nTransfer fritters to a platter.

  "Instructions": "Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Lightly butter the inside of a 9-inch (23-cm) springform pan.\r\nMake the crust: Crumble the crackers and cookies into a medium bowl. Use a pestle or the bottom of a heavy bottle to crush them into fine crumbs. Add ⅓ cup (75 ml) of the condensed milk and stir until very well combined.

Bake until the crust looks a little darker and smells sweet and toasty, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool the crust in the pan on a wire rack.\r\nOne at a time, cut an avocado in half lengthwise. Twist the halves to separate them. Hold the half with the pit in one hand. Holding the knife in your other hand, rap the knife blade into the pit to lodge it there.

Add the juice to the avocados and process the mixture until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.\r\nSpread the filling in the cooled crust and sprinkle with the grated lemon zest. Cover the pan and freeze until the filling is firm, at least 6 hours or preferably overnight.\r\nLet the frozen cake stand at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes before slicing.

Add the Parmesan shavings and the balsamic vinegar (if you’re using it); toss. Taste for seasonings and add more salt and pepper if needed.\r\nServe warm or at room temperature.\r\nLocalize it: You can use kale instead of chard, and any nut will work in place of the hazelnuts.

Keep breaking up the bits of butter until the texture is very coarse.\r\nIn a small dish, whisk together the sour cream, vinegar, and water, and combine it with the butter-flour mixture. Using a spatula or wooden spoon, stir the wet and the dry together until a shaggy dough forms. If needed, get your hands into the bowl to knead it a few times into one big ball.

Add red onion, garlic, carrots, red wine vinegar, sherry vinegar, honey, paprika, reserved ground coriander, 4 Tbsp. oil, remaining 4 tsp. salt, and 2 Tbsp. water to pot. Set over low heat, cover, and bring liquid to a gentle simmer. Cook, stirring vegetables often to keep submerged, until just-cooked through and still al dente, about 10 minutes. Remove escabèche from heat and stir in oregano.\r\nHeat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in reserved skillet over high. Arrange pork chops in pan so bone ends are in the center (this part cooks slower and this will help with even browning) and press down on pork chops with tongs to ensure surface is making good contact with the pan. Cook until golden underneath, about 3 minutes. Turn pork chops over and press down on them again. Transfer to oven and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 130° for medium (you should still have a little pink flesh; temperature should rise to about 145° when the pork chops rest), 5–7 minutes. Transfer pork chops to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes.\r\nTo serve, transfer pork chops to plates and spoon escabèche over.\r\nDo ahead: Escabèche can be made 2 weeks ahead. Transfer to an airtight container and let cool. Cover and chill.",

  "Instructions": "Mix the chicken pieces, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl. Transfer to a large zipper-lock bag, add the potato starch, close the bag, and mix well by flipping the bag over and back again until the chicken is well coated.\r\nPlace a large mesh strainer over a bowl.\r\nHeat 2 inches vegetable oil in a large, deep pan or wok over medium-high heat until it reaches about 340°F, 8 to 10 minutes. If you don’t have a thermometer, test it by dipping a tip of a chicken piece into the oil. If it bubbles, it’s ready. Carefully add the chicken to the oil one piece at a time, working in batches to avoid overcrowding.\r\nDeep-fry, turning the chicken with tongs, until all sides are light golden brown and crunchy, 10 to 12 minutes. As each piece is done, transfer it to the strainer. Once the chicken has drained, transfer it to a large bowl. Repeat with the rest of the chicken, making sure to bring the oil back up to 340°F between batches.\r\nReturn the oil to 340°F over high heat and carefully add all the chicken—there’s no need to work in batches this time. The chicken will look a little soggy at first. Deep-fry, turning occasionally, until all the chicken pieces are dark golden brown and very crunchy, another 10 to 13 minutes. Transfer the chicken pieces to the strainer or a rack to drain, then place in a large bowl.\r\nIf using the peanuts, place them in a slotted spoon or a small mesh strainer, carefully dip them into the hot oil, and fry for 15 to 30 seconds, just until light golden brown. Transfer to a small bowl.\r\nMix the rice syrup, soy sauce, sugar, vinegar, and mustard in a small bowl.\r\nHeat a large pan or wok over medium-high heat. Add the oil, garlic, ginger, and chili peppers and stir for 30 seconds to 1 minute, until the garlic is a little crispy and fragrant. Add the soy sauce mixture and stir. Let it bubble for 2 to 3 minutes, until the mixture is shiny and a little sticky. Remove from the heat if not using right away and reheat until bubbling when ready to finish the chicken.\r\nAdd the chicken and peanuts (if using) to the bubbling sauce and toss with a wooden spoon to coat nicely. Sprinkle with the toasted sesame seeds and a few teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes (if using). Transfer to a large plate or platter and serve. The chicken will remain crunchy for several hours if left at room temperature, or you can cover and refrigerate it for up to 3 days.",

  "Ingredients": "['1 3½–4-lb. whole chicken', '3 tsp. white or black peppercorns', '6 garlic cloves', '2 cilantro roots, chopped, or 2 Tbsp. (heaping) finely chopped cilantro stems', '3 Tbsp. (packed) light brown sugar', '2 Tbsp. fish sauce', '4 tsp. ground turmeric', '1 Tbsp. kosher salt', '2 tsp. ground coriander', '2 tsp. ground cumin', '1 tsp. ground cardamom', '½ cup (packed) chopped fresh ripe pineapple', '¼ cup distilled white vinegar or apple cider vinegar', '6 large garlic cloves, finely chopped', '3 red jalapeños or serrano chiles, seeds removed, finely chopped', '¼ cup granulated sugar', '1 tsp. kosher salt', '½ tsp. freshly ground white pepper', '1 tsp. (lightly packed) saffron threads or 1 tsp. ground turmeric', '2 tsp. granulated sugar', '1 tsp. kosher salt', '⅓ cup virgin coconut oil', 'Vegetable oil (for grill; optional)', '1 Tbsp. coarsely chopped cilantro', 'Cooked jasmine rice, coconut rice, or sticky rice (for serving)', 'A spice mill or a mortar and pestle']",
  "Instructions": "Spatchcock chicken the Thai way by placing it breast side up on a large cutting board. Using a sharp, heavy knife and working just to the side of the center of the breast, cut down through to the breastbone (do not cut all the way through to the backbone). Now that the path has been created, use the same knife—or, easier, a sturdy pair of kitchen scissors—to make a clean cut all the way through the breastbone and anything else that is still connecting the 2 sides of the breast together. Open up chicken and turn skin side up. Press down on chicken to flatten. Pat thoroughly dry.\r\nGrind peppercorns in a spice mill or a mortar and pestle. Transfer to a food processor or leave in mortar and pestle and add garlic, cilantro roots, brown sugar, fish sauce, turmeric, salt, coriander, cumin, and cardamom and process or pound until smooth. Coat chicken completely in marinade, pressing to adhere and working into nooks and crannies. Place in a large bowl and cover with a plate. Let chill at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours.\r\nLet chicken sit at room temperature 1 hour before grilling or baking.\r\nPurée pineapple and vinegar in a food processor or blender until smooth. Transfer to a small saucepan and add garlic, jalapeños, granulated sugar, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce heat so sauce is at a simmer and cook until thick and smooth (consistency should be similar to cocktail sauce), about 5 minutes.\r\nGrind saffron to a fine powder in a spice mill or a mortar and pestle. Transfer to a small saucepan and add granulated sugar, salt, and ¼ cup water and cook over medium heat just until heated through and small bubbles appear around the edges of the pan. Whisk in coconut oil and remove from heat.\r\nIf using a grill, prepare a grill for medium-high indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off); oil grate. Arrange chicken, skin side up, on cooler part of grill. Close lid and grill, rotating chicken but keeping skin side up every 5–10 minutes, until skin looks dry and golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast and thighs registers 130°–140°, 35–40 minutes. If using charcoal and your coals are dying, start a new chimney of coals 15 minutes before this point so you are ready for the next step.\r\nUncover grill and increase heat to high (add more coals for a charcoal grill). Brush one fourth of basting liquid over skin and turn chicken over, positioning over direct heat on the hot side of the grill. Grill, brushing half of remaining basting liquid over bone side of chicken, until skin is browned and lightly charred in spots, about 3 minutes. (Watch carefully as this can happen quickly.) Turn chicken over and return to cooler side of grill. Brush skin with remaining basting liquid. Cover grill and continue to grill chicken until thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast registers 160° and thickest part of thighs registers 165°, 10–15 minutes longer.\r\nIf using an oven, place a rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 350°. Place chicken, skin side up, on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Brush one third of basting liquid over skin. Bake, rotating baking sheet every 10 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast and thighs registers 130°–140°, 35–40 minutes.\r\nIncrease oven temperature to 450°. Brush remaining basting liquid over skin and continue to bake, rotating baking sheet halfway through, until skin is crisp and charred and thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast registers 160° and thickest part of thighs registers 165°, 10–15 minutes longer.\r\nTransfer chicken to a cutting board and let rest at least 15 minutes. Carve up further as desired.\r\nTop dipping sauce with cilantro. Serve chicken with rice and dipping sauce alongside.\r\nIf you cook the chicken in the oven, using the dhungar method to perfume the finished chicken with the scent of smoky ghee is highly recommended.",

Whisk egg yolks and 1 Tbsp. cold water in a small bowl to combine.\r\nWhisk all-purpose flour, almond flour, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl. Add butter and rub and smash into dry ingredients with your fingers to create large, shaggy pieces (you want some pieces that are flat and thin and some that are large and irregular).\r\nDrizzle egg yolk mixture over flour and, using a fork or your fingers, toss into dough to incorporate. Knead dough in bowl until it starts to come together (it will still look a little dry; although, if it looks too dry and doesn't come together, add 1–2 Tbsp. more water, but only if needed).\r\nTurn dough out onto a clean work surface and knead 1 or 2 more times.

Remove from heat.\r\nMeanwhile, whisk egg yolks, sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a medium bowl, starting slowly—it won’t want to combine easily at first—then vigorously whisk until mixture is very pale yellow and very thick, about 1 minute (the sugar should be nearly dissolved at this point). Whisking constantly, gradually add hot milk mixture. Return custard base to saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat, whisking constantly. Simmer, still whisking constantly, until custard is thickened and has no cornstarch taste, about 3 minutes.\r\nRemove custard from heat and add butter a couple of pieces at a time, whisking until fully melted before adding more, until all of the butter is incorporated. Transfer to a medium bowl and cover with plastic wrap, pressing directly against surface. Let cool.\r\nVigorously whisk custard until smooth and slightly loosened. Scrape into crust and smooth surface. Top with berries.\r\nDo Ahead: Custard can be made 4 days ahead. Keep chilled.",

  "Ingredients": "['1 gallon cold water', '1 (6-inch) square dashima (kombu)', '3 medium dried shiitake mushrooms', '12 large dried anchovies (gutted and heads removed)']",
  "Instructions": "Put the water, dashima, shiitake mushrooms, and anchovies in a covered stockpot or other large pot and let stand at room temperature overnight, or for 8 to 12 hours.\r\nRemove the lid, set the pot over high heat, and heat until the surface of the water begins to ripple; pay attention, and do not let it come to a boil. Lower the heat to maintain a very gentle simmer (the ideal temperature is a few degrees below a light boil) and simmer for 80 to 90 minutes. Taste the dashi every 20 minutes to monitor the changes in flavor and texture. You will notice the texture becoming softer. I describe it as having a slippery, slightly viscous texture compared to tap water. The sea flavor will become stronger, and the dashi will become darker, like pale Earl Grey tea. The sweetness will take a while to appear, but when it does, the dashi is almost ready. When you can taste the sweetness and deep sea flavors, and the dashi has a very soft texture, it is done. Be vigilant, because dashi will become bitter if cooked too long.\r\nStrain the dashi into a covered container and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. After 24 hours, the dashi will begin to lose some of its flavor and it will turn slightly flat.\r\nIt’s best to use dashi the same day you make it, though if you keep it refrigerated, you can use it for another day or two. By the third day, it will no longer taste fresh.\r\nVegetarians can make a dashi from just dashima and dried shiitakes.",

  "Title": "Ginger and Tamarind Refresher",
  "Ingredients": "['2½ cups (600 ml) water', '2½ oz (70 g) sour tamarind pulp or paste', '8 oz (225 g) fresh ginger, preferably young', '1 cup (200 g) sugar', 'One 1 L bottle chilled club soda or 4 cups (960 ml) chilled water']",
  "Instructions": "Bring 1½ cups (360 ml) of the water to a boil. Put the tamarind pulp in a heat-proof nonreactive bowl, and cover with the boiling water. Cover and let sit for about 1 hour, until the pulp has become soft and mushy. Using a small potato masher or clean hands, massage and squeeze the block to soften the pulp. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer suspended over a medium bowl, pressing the pulp through the strainer with a large spoon. Discard the seeds and other solids left behind. Refrigerate the tamarind extract in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to use, for up to 4 days.\r\nRinse the ginger and gently scrub to remove any traces of dirt. If the ginger is young, with a thin skin, leave the skin on. Otherwise, peel. Cut into thin slices. In a medium saucepan, combine the ginger, sugar, and remaining 1 cup (240 ml) water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and immediately remove the saucepan from the heat. Cover and steep for 10 minutes. Strain the ginger simple syrup through a fine-mesh strainer and discard the ginger.\r\nIn a large pitcher, mix the tamarind extract and the ginger simple syrup together. Fill eight tall glasses with ice. Pour 4 oz (120 ml) of the tamarind-ginger syrup into each glass, top with 4 oz (120 ml) of the club soda or chilled water, and stir. Store any remaining tamarind-ginger syrup in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.\r\nThis rejuvenating drink combines the mild heat of young ginger and the sourness of tamarind. It’s wonderful during the warmer months. Young ginger requires no peeling before use because its outer skin is so thin. I recommend using South Asian tamarind, which is a lot more sour than the Mexican variety. Look for it in Asian and Indian markets.",

  "Ingredients": "['15 to 20 saffron strands, plus a few extra strands for garnish', '½ cup (100 g) sugar', '3 green cardamom pods, smashed', '¼ cup (30 g) ground sumac', '3 cups (700 ml) chilled club soda or water']",
  "Instructions": "Grind the saffron with 2 Tbsp. of sugar to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle.\r\nIn a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine 1 cup (240 ml) water, sugar, cardamom, and powdered saffron mixture and bring to simmer, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat and stir in the sumac. Cover the saucepan with a lid and let it steep for 30 minutes, no more. Strain the liquid through a fine mesh strainer over a medium bowl and chill before ready to serve.\r\nTo serve, fill four tall glasses with ice. In a large pitcher, stir the syrup with the chilled club soda or water. Pour 1 cup (120 ml) of the drink into each glass. Garnish each glass with 1 or 2 saffron strands. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.\r\nSumac is rich in citric, malic, and tartaric acids but also bitter tannins. Steeping it in water dissolves the water-soluble acids. Gallotannin, one of the main tannins present in sumac, is bitter to taste and dissolves in water easily. Avoid steeping the sumac for too long or its tannins will make the syrup bitter. Saffron is ground to a fine powder using a little sugar as an abrasive. Grinding saffron increases the amount of color and flavor extracted than would be achieved if the strands were used directly. Club soda if used, adds a second note of acidity from the carbonic acid as well as the crackling sound of bubbles that create a sensation via chemesthesis.",

  "Instructions": "Warm 3 teaspoons of the oil in a frying pan over medium-low heat. Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes, stirring gently. Add the garlic and continue to cook for 3 minutes. (If, at any time during the cooking process, the items in the pan dry out at all, deglaze the pan with some lime juice, scraping up the browned bits with a wooden spoon, and continue.) Turn the heat to medium and add the chiles. Cook for 10 minutes, or until the chiles are thoroughly cooked.\r\nAt this point, warm a separate frying pan over medium heat and add the remaining 1 teaspoon oil. Interleaved with finishing the rest of the recipe, heat each tortilla in the oil-coated pan for about 20 seconds per side, just long enough to make them the slightest bit golden but still pliable, and put between two towels to stay warm and wick away any excess oil.\r\nOnce the chiles have cooked for 10 minutes, pour the lime juice on the ingredients in the pan. Add the diced bacon to the pan and turn the heat to medium-high. When the pan has heated up and the bacon has started to turn color, add the shrimp and use the salt to season everything in the pan. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring and flipping the shrimp as necessary to cook them evenly. The shrimp should be bright pink and white and opaque. If they are still translucent, cook them a little longer.\r\nSprinkle the cheese over everything in the pan and turn the heat to low. Continue stirring until the cheese is melted. Remove the pan from the heat. Distribute the cheesy shrimp mixture equally among the tortillas, making a plate full of tacos. Serve along with the lime wedges and red salsa, if desired.",

  "Instructions": "Preheat oven to 275°F. Place crackers in a deep pie dish (a shallower one will work but you may have some filling left over) and gently crush with your hands until you have a mix of dime-size pieces, small crumbs, and everything in between. Add peanuts, brown sugar, and salt and toss to combine. Drizzle in butter and toss to evenly coat. Using your hands and the bottom of a measuring cup, press firmly and evenly into bottom and up sides of dish. (Mixture will look and feel crumbly, but it will hold together when baked.) Bake crust until a shade darker, 20–25 minutes. Let cool.\r\nDo Ahead: Crust can be baked 3 days ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature, or freeze up to 1 month.\r\nPour water into a medium saucepan to come 1½\" up the sides and bring to a bare simmer over medium-low heat. Whisk eggs, brown sugar, and salt in a large heatproof bowl just to combine (or use the bowl of a stand mixer if you’ve got one). Set over saucepan (bowl should not touch water) and heat egg mixture, stirring constantly with a heatproof rubber spatula, until sugar dissolves, about 4 minutes (mixture will no longer feel gritty when rubbed between your fingers). If you are concerned about undercooked eggs, heat mixture longer, still stirring constantly, until an instant-read thermometer registers 165°F, about 3 minutes more. Remove bowl from heat and add vanilla to egg mixture. Using an electric mixer, beat on high speed until thick and pale and doubled in volume, about 10 minutes. (Or, if using a stand mixer, beat with the whisk attachment, 6–8 minutes.)\r\nUsing spatula, mix peanut butter in another large bowl to loosen up and smooth out. Stir one third of egg mixture into peanut butter to lighten, then gently fold in half of remaining egg mixture, running spatula down sides and along bottom of bowl, then lifting up through center and over top while rotating bowl, until just combined. Repeat with remaining egg mixture (it will lose a lot of volume, and that’s okay).\r\nStarting on low speed and gradually increasing to medium-high, beat cream in the same bowl you used for egg mixture (no need to wash) until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. Gently fold into peanut butter mixture and scrape into crust. Dollop jelly all over; swirl with a butter knife. (For more defined swirls, freeze pie 30 minutes before adding jelly.) Freeze at least 8 hours before serving.\r\nTo slice, run a chef’s knife under hot water to warm up the blade, then wipe to clean and dry between slices. Use an offset spatula or fork to loosen slices from dish. If pie is frozen very hard, you may need to let it temper in the fridge 30 minutes before serving.\r\nDo Ahead: Pie can be made 2 weeks ahead. Wrap tightly and freeze.",

Increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes burst and their juices start to thicken, 8–10 minutes.\r\nNestle chicken thighs into tomatoes, skin side up. Reduce heat to medium-low, bring to a simmer, and cook until chicken is just cooked through and flesh is no longer pink (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part near the bone will register 165°F), and tomato sauce is thickened so that a wooden spoon dragged through it leaves a trail, 6–8 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit 5 minutes.\r\nBreak feta into large pieces; scatter over chicken. Some pieces will stay intact while others will soften into the sauce a little—and that's exactly what you want. Pick leaves off remaining 2 oregano sprigs and scatter on top.\r\nServe with bread for sopping up any extra tomato sauce.",

  "Instructions": "To make the sauce, put the oil into a saucepan or casserole pan with a lid—about 10 inches/25cm wide—and place over medium heat. Add the onions and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until soft and caramelized. Add the rest of the sauce ingredients, along with 2½ tsp of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Simmer over medium heat for about 10 minutes, stirring from time to time, then remove from the heat and set aside.\r\nTo make the stuffing, while the sauce is cooking, place all the ingredients in a large bowl with 1½ tsp of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Mix well, using your hands to make sure that everything is well incorporated. If making in advance, keep in the fridge until ready to use.\r\nTrim the stalks from the eggplants, then insert a manakra (or peeler or corer) into the eggplant; you want it to be very close to the skin—about ⅛ inch/3mm away—but not so close that it tears and won’t hold its shape when it’s stuffed. Scoop out the flesh to create a generous cavity. You don’t need the flesh anymore, but keep it for another recipe; it can be cut into cubes and steamed or added to your next omelette. If your eggplants are particularly large, slice them in half, crosswise, and scoop out the flesh using a regular small serrated knife—be sure to keep one end of each half intact, so that the stuffing does not fall out!\r\nUse the manakra or a swivel peeler to scoop out the zucchini flesh. Keep about ⅛ inch/3mm of flesh attached to the skin inside the zucchini and about ½ inch/1cm from the end intact—they need to be robust enough to keep the stuffing inside. Again, keep the scooped-out flesh to use elsewhere.\r\nUsing your hands, so that you can push in a bit of stuffing at a time, fill all the eggplant and zucchini cavities. Stop filling them about ½ inch/1cm from the top of each vegetable; the stuffing needs some space to expand inside the vegetables when they are cooking.\r\nGently lower the stuffed vegetables into the sauce. They won’t fit in a single layer, but try to avoid too much overlap and submerge them in the sauce as much as you can. Return the sauce to medium heat and, once simmering, decrease the heat to low. Cover the pan and simmer very gently for 90 minutes, or until the rice is completely cooked through and soft—test if it is ready by sticking a knife into the middle of one of the vegetables; it should go in very easily. Don’t worry if some of the rice/stuffing spills into the tomato sauce, this can happen and it will be fine when served.\r\nTo make the adha, meanwhile, put the oil into a small frying pan and place over medium heat. After about 1 minute, add the garlic and decrease the heat to medium-low. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring very often, until the garlic is golden and crispy. Keep a close eye on the pan here; you don’t want the oil to get too hot and for the garlic to burn. Reserving the oil as you pour, strain the garlic through a sieve. Set the garlic aside—it will crisp up as it cools down—and return the oil to the pan. Add the coriander seeds and chile and cook for about 1 minute, stirring a few times, until fragrant. Remove from the heat, transfer to a separate bowl, and set aside until needed.\r\nWhen the vegetables are cooked and the sauce is thick and rich (but still pourable), use a slotted spoon to carefully lift the vegetables out of the pan. Pour the sauce onto a large serving platter (or individual serving plates) with a rim and top with the stuffed vegetables. Spoon on the adha—the coriander-chile oil first, followed by the fried garlic—then sprinkle with the fresh herbs and green onion. Serve warm or at room temperature, with the yogurt spooned alongside.",

  "Instructions": "Bring plums, brown sugar, and salt to a boil in a medium heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until fruit is softened and juices deepen in color, about 8 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve set over a medium bowl, pushing plum flesh through; discard skins. Return sauce to pan and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Cook, still stirring, until reduced to about ⅔ cup, about 3 minutes. Pour ripple into a jar and let cool, then cover and chill 1 hour before using.\r\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°F. Place walnuts on 1 side of a rimmed baking sheet; season with salt. Toast, tossing halfway through, 8 minutes (nuts should not be quiet golden brown yet). Remove from oven and add sesame seeds on empty side of baking sheet. Toast until nuts and seeds are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Let cool; chop nuts. Combine nuts, sesame seeds, maple syrup, and salt in a small jar or bowl and stir well. Cover and set aside.\r\nLightly butter pan and line with a parchment paper round. Heat brown sugar, tahini, and remaining ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter until bubbling in a medium heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring until butter is melted and sugar is dissolved. Cook, without stirring, 1 minute. Let cool slightly.\r\nStir vanilla bean paste and salt followed by egg into brown sugar mixture. Sift flour and baking powder through a fine-mesh sieve into mixture and fold to barely combine. Scrape batter into the prepared pan. Bake until golden around the edges, evenly tan across the top, and puffed in the center, about 20 minutes.\r\nTransfer pan to a wire rack and let blondie base cool. Run a knife around the sides to help base release but keep springform pan intact, then cover and chill in freezer at least 15 minutes or until ready to use.\r\nCut 3 pints of ice cream out of their containers and place in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. (Alternatively, you can beat in a large bowl with a wooden spoon or stiff rubber spatula until the consistency of cake batter.) Mix on low speed 2 minutes, then working up to medium speed, beat until barely pliable. It will soften further as it sits, but you want it to be sticky and slightly challenging to spread when you assemble cake. Chill in the freezer at any point if it becomes too soft and melted.\r\nRemove blondie base and remaining 2 still-frozen pints of ice cream from freezer. Using an offset spatula, spread a third of softened ice cream over base. Using a spring-loaded ice cream scoop, scoop out and place mounds of 1-pint still-frozen ice cream on top in a random manner. Dollop one third of maple ripple over ice cream, avoiding edges of pan. Next, drizzle one third of plum ripple over ice cream, creating stripes. Repeat layering process, using half of remaining softened ice cream, all of remaining frozen ice cream, half of remaining maple ripple, and half of remaining plum ripple. Top with a final layer of remaining softened ice cream, smooth surface, then drizzle with remaining maple ripple and plum ripple. (If at any point the ice cream gets so soft that you can’t achieve distinct layers, chill in freezer for a few minutes.) Freeze, uncovered, 2 hours, then cover and freeze at least 8 hours before serving.\r\nTo serve, run a knife or offset spatula around edge of pan to release. Unmold and remove parchment paper; discard. Transfer cake to a platter, smooth sides with an offset spatula, and freeze 10 minutes. Slice with a warm knife, wiping off between cuts.",

  "Ingredients": "['10 large peaches (about 4½ pounds), unpeeled, cut into 1-inch chunks', 'Zest and juice of 1 large lemon', '½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened', '2 cups sugar, divided', '1½ cups (about 192 grams) all-purpose flour', '2 teaspoons baking powder', '1 teaspoon kosher salt', '¾ cup whole milk', '½ cup hot tap water', 'Heavy cream, for serving']",
  "Instructions": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.\r\nPut the peaches in a 9-by-13-inch (or similar) baking pan or gratin dish. Pat the peaches into a roughly even layer, then, using a zester or a Microplane, zest the lemon evenly over the fruit and squeeze the lemon juice evenly over the top.\r\nIn the work bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and 1½ cups of the sugar on medium speed until sandy, about 1 minute. Add the flour, baking powder, and salt, and beat again for another 30 seconds, until all the flour is incorporated and the mixture is evenly crumbly. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add in the milk. Increase the speed to medium and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.\r\nPlop the batter in 6 large blobs over the top of the peaches. With an offset spatula or small knife, carefully spread the batter evenly over the fruit, so it’s no more than about ½ inch thick in any one place.\r\nSprinkle the remaining ½ cup sugar directly over the batter. Drizzle the hot water evenly over the sugar, using it to melt the sugar into the topping. (Use it all. It’s a strange method, but it works.)\r\nBake the cobbler for 70 to 80 minutes, or until the top is browned and cracked. (A toothpick inserted into the topping should come out dry—be sure to check in a few places.)\r\nLet the cobbler sit for about a half an hour to firm up before serving warm in big bowls, with heavy cream poured on top.",

  "Title": "Pajeon (파 전 / Scallion Pancakes)",
  "Ingredients": "['2 cups all-purpose flour', '½ cup cornstarch', '2 teaspoons baking powder', '2 teaspoons sugar', '1 teaspoon doenjang (Korean fermentedsoybean paste)', '½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper', '2 cups ice-cold club soda', '1 medium egg yolk', '2 teaspoons minced garlic', '3 bunches scallions, cut into 2-inch batons (if the scallions are thick, cut the white parts lengthwise in half before cutting into batons)', 'About 5 tablespoons grape seed or canola oil, for frying', 'Pajeon Sauce']",
  "Instructions": "To make the batter, combine the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, sugar, doenjang, and pepper in a medium bowl and mix well to blend. Add the club soda, egg yolk, and garlic and mix gently using a whisk. Do not whisk too much, or extra gluten will form in the batter, making it too thick and doughy. Whisk about 10 times, then let the batter rest for 10 minutes in the freezer so any remaining small clumps of flour can dissolve and blend into the mixture by themselves.\r\nWhen you’re ready to make the pancakes, line a sheet pan with paper towels and set aside. Fold the scallions into the cold batter.\r\nSet a 10-inch nonstick sauté pan over high heat and add about 1 tablespoon of the oil. When the oil begins to shimmer and just barely smoke, add 1 cup of the scallion batter to the center of the pan. Using a spatula, spread it out to form a 7-inch pancake. (You don’t want the pancake to touch the sides of the pan, or the edges may burn before the center is cooked through.) Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the bottom of the pancake has set. Once it has set, gently slide your spatula under the edges of the pancake and lift them, tilting the pan, so some of the hot oil runs underneath the pancake. Then cook for 2 to 3 minutes more, until the bottom is a deep golden brown and crisp. You can check the color by gently lifting an edge of the pancake with your spatula. Flip the pancake and cook on the other side for 3 to 4 minutes, until it is golden brown on the second side and cooked through. Transfer to the prepared sheet pan to drain. Wipe out the pan, set it back over high heat, add another tablespoon or so of oil, and repeat until all of the pancakes are cooked. The finished pancakes can be kept in a low (200°F) oven on a clean sheet pan while you cook the remaining batches, but it’s best to eat them right away.\r\nCut each pancake into quarters and serve with small bowls of the Pajeon Sauce and ice-cold makgeolli (Korean rice wine).",

  "Ingredients": "['⅓ cup vegetable oil', '4 Tbsp. whole black mustard seeds (or 4 tbsp. store-bought coarsely crushed mustard seeds)', '3 Tbsp. whole fenugreek seeds (or 3 Tbsp. store-bought coarsely crushed fenugreek)', '1 tsp. asafetida powder', '1 Tbsp. ground cayenne (to taste) or 1 large serrano pepper, deseeded, and sliced thin', '⅓ cup julienned ginger (optional, see Pre-Prep below)', '2-4 Tbsp. white vinegar', '2 tsp. kosher salt (optional)', '2 cups mixed vegetables, prepped as follows']",
  "Instructions": "Pre-Prep: Trim fresh vegetables like cauliflower, carrots, radish, and others into bite sized pieces, and no larger than the container they will be stored in. Flash steam firm vegetables like cauliflower and carrots in a colander over boiling water for just a minute or two: the pieces should still be firm. Lay them on a kitchen towel to dry. If using fresh turmeric, cover the chopping board in plastic wrap, and wear gloves. Scrape off the skin with a spoon as you would for ginger and rinse it clean to wash away any tough bits. Pat each fingerling down and slice into thin rounds or to match the ginger, and place on a paper towel to air dry. All vegetables must be dry to touch before pickling. To prepare ginger, peel and slice ginger into eighth-inch-thick slices, and chop them to look like carrot sticks. Spread on a paper towel and set aside to air dry for 15-20 minutes.\r\nIf using whole mustard seeds or whole fenugreek seeds, in two separate sets, crush each in a spice mill in short bursts until they each are broken down but not powdered. They should be the consistency of coffee grounds.\r\nMethod: Heat the oil in a large, wide mouth saucepan until it is hot but not smoking. Reduce the heat to low. Slowly add all the spices: mustard halves, fenugreek halves, asafetida powder, cayenne pepper if using, along with the serrano pepper if using, and ginger sticks. Add vinegar and salt. Allow this to sizzle for a minute on low. Stir to allow the heat to distribute evenly. When the oil is aromatic, slowly add the trimmed vegetables and stir in well. Turn up the heat and let this cook for 4-5 minutes until vegetables appear to have absorbed the spices a little. Turn off the heat and cover with a paper towel to capture any steam. Allow this to come to room temperature before storing.\r\nTo Store: Use smaller (4 – 6 oz.) sanitized and dried glass jars to store the pickle. Using a clean and dry spoon that is smaller than the mouth of the jar, ladle out portions of the pickle into each jar. Don’t worry if you don’t get the oils or juices when first filling the jars. Fill jars at least a half inch below the rim of the jar. Shake them once to allow the pieces to settle. Divide up any of the liquid over each of these jars, taking care that each jar has some of the spicy sauce. Lightly shake each jar to ensure the liquid finds its way into the nooks and crannies of vegetable pieces. Close the lid and store in the fridge. The pickle is ready to eat immediately after it is made, but the flavors are pronounced after a day or two. Serve using a clean and dry fork or spoon for each serving to avoid contamination.",

Open chicken and turn skin side up. Press down on center of breast to flatten chicken—you should hear the breastbone crack. Using a chef’s knife or cleaver, split chicken in half through breastbone. Pat dry; rub all over with 1 Tbsp. oil. Sprinkle reserved seasoning all over, making sure to get into all the nooks and crannies. Place on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Chill, uncovered, at least 8 hours and up to 2 days.\r\nCoarsely grind remaining 2 Tbsp. pink peppercorns in spice mill or mortar and pestle. Cook chiles, honey, vinegar, and remaining 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture just turns amber in color and is reduced by about half (it should coat a spoon), 10–12 minutes. Stir in pink pepper and set aside.\r\nPrepare a grill for medium heat. Lightly oil grate. Set chicken on grate, cover, positioning vent over chicken if your grill has one, and grill, turning every 5 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of thighs registers 120°–130°F, 15–20 minutes. Continue to grill, basting with honey mixture and turning chicken every 2–3 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of thighs registers 175°F and 155°F in the thickest part of breast, 10–15 minutes longer.

  "Instructions": "The morning before you make your batter, rinse rice in a fine-mesh sieve under cold running water, until water runs almost clear. Transfer to a large bowl and cover with 4 cups cold water. If your tap water is heavily chlorinated, use filtered water for soaking as chlorine will inhibit fermentation later on.\r\nPick over dal for debris, then rinse in sieve under cold running water. Transfer to a medium bowl and add fenugreek. Cover with 2 cups cold water (again using filtered if needed). Let rice and dal soak at least 8 hours and up to 10 hours.\r\nDrain rice, holding back grains with your hand and pouring off most of the soaking liquid into a pitcher or large measuring glass. Transfer rice to a blender. Pulse to get things going, then purée, sparingly adding soaking liquid as needed, until a paste forms (mixture should be foamy and still slightly gritty when rubbed between your fingers). Pour into a clean large bowl. Repeat process with dal mixture, then vigorously stir blended dal into rice paste.\r\nAdd reserved soaking liquid as needed to create a pourable batter that falls off the spoon in a steady stream and gradually dissolves into itself. Stir in salt. (If you are in a warm climate, add salt after fermentation to keep batter from becoming overly sour.) Cover bowl with a kitchen towel, then a silicone lid (this will keep the surface of the batter from drying out). Set bowl in a warm spot (a proofing box or an oven with the light on and a bowl of hot water placed inside work well). Let batter sit until airy and pleasantly sour (when you drizzle it from a spoon, it should fall on itself in slowly dissolving ribbons), 4–6 hours in a very warm environment and as long as 2 days in a very cool environment. In general, 14 hours is a safe starting point.\r\nDo ahead: Batter can be made 1 week ahead. Once fermented, cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before cooking. Thin with water if needed to reach a thick but pourable consistency.\r\nHeat 2 tsp. oil in a medium skillet over medium. Cook onion, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add green chiles and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Reduce heat to low, add tomatoes and any juices and a generous pinch of salt. Cook, stirring often, until tomatoes are tender, 7–9 minutes. Carefully transfer to clean blender or a food processor and blend until smooth; reserve skillet. Taste chutney and season with more salt if needed. Transfer to a small bowl.\r\nWipe out reserved skillet and heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in skillet over medium. Cook mustard seeds, stirring constantly, until they start to pop, about 30 seconds. Add curry leaves, dried red chile, and dal and cook, stirring occasionally, until curry leaves wilt and crisp and dal is starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Mix in asafoetida, if using, and remove spice oil from heat. Mix into chutney.\r\nTo cook dosas, heat a griddle or large skillet (the larger the better; you want the batter to have room to spread) over medium. Sprinkle a little water on surface; if it sizzles you’re good to go. (It’s important though not to let griddle get hotter than medium. If it’s too hot, the batter will start to cook before it’s fully spread out, yielding a thick dosa, or worse, a thin dosa that tears. Adjust heat as needed). Brush griddle with a thin layer of ghee, wiping off excess with a folded paper towel. Ladle a generous ⅓-cupful of batter in the center of griddle and use ladle to spread batter, working outward in continuous circles and never lifting ladle off surface, to create an 8\"-diameter round. Ridges of thick and thin batter will form naturally. Cook dosa 30 seconds, then drizzle ⅛ tsp. ghee over batter. For a spongier dosa, cover with a large bowl and steam until cooked through, about 2 minutes (cooked underside should show through thinner spots, and thicker spots should be opaque and bouncy). For a drier dosa, cook until surface is mostly set, about 2 minutes, then, using a fish spatula or other wide spatula, flip dosa over (it should easily lift from the griddle at this point) and cook until second side is lightly golden, about 20 seconds. Fold dosa in half so toasted side is facing out and transfer to a plate. Repeat process with remaining batter and ghee.\r\nServe dosas as they are ready with chutney alongside for dipping.",

  "Instructions": "Toast almonds in a dry small skillet over medium heat, tossing occasionally, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and let cool. Set aside for serving.\r\nBlend garlic, dill, mint, tahini, and ⅓ cup water in a blender or food processor until a thick paste forms. Add lemon juice and blend again, adding an additional 1–2 Tbsp. water if sauce is too thick. It should be easily spreadable but not runny. Season with salt and lots of pepper.\r\nRemove outer leaves and trim stem from cauliflower so it sits flat. Cut cauliflower into 4 wedges.\r\nWhisk oil, coriander, cumin, turmeric, and a big pinch of salt in a large bowl to combine. Add cauliflower and coat in oil. The cauliflower can fall apart easily, so handle with care and use your fingers to work oil into the uneven surface.\r\nPrepare a grill for medium-high heat (if using a charcoal grill, bank most of the coals on one side of the grill). Place cauliflower, cut side down, on grate over hottest part of grill and grill, undisturbed, until char marks form, about 3 minutes (you can carefully lift to check, but try not to move too much). Turn over onto other cut side and grill, undisturbed, until grill marks form, about 3 minutes. Turn onto uneven floret side and slide over to cooler part of grill or reduce heat to low and cover with lid. Grill until tender (if a bamboo skewer easily slides through the thickest part, it’s done), 10–15 minutes. (And if you don’t have a grill, you can do this in a grill pan over high. Once pan is very hot, add cauliflower, reduce heat to medium-high, and cook both cut sides as above. When you turn cauliflower over onto uneven floret side, reduce heat to low and cover pan with foil to finish cooking.)\r\nTo serve, spread some tarator onto individual plates or a platter. Arrange cauliflower wedges on top and dollop remaining tarator over. Scatter mixed tender herbs and almonds on top.",

  "Ingredients": "['3 medium shallots, thinly sliced crosswise, rings separated', '1 Tbsp. plus 1½ tsp. red wine vinegar', '1 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes', '1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper', 'Kosher salt', '3 oz. Pecorino Romano, Grana Padano, or Parmigiano-Reggiano', '2 cups (loosely packed) mixed tender herb leaves or greens (such as parsley and dill or dill and arugula)', '5 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil', '1 lb. king trumpet or crimini mushrooms, trimmed', '6 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil', '6 1\"-thick slices country-style bread']",
  "Instructions": "Six–eight 10\" metal skewers or bamboo skewers, soaked (optional)\r\nToss shallots, vinegar, red pepper flakes, and black pepper in a small bowl to combine; lightly season with salt (the Pecorino will add some saltiness, so bear that in mind). Let sit 3 minutes.\r\nMeanwhile, very thinly slice Pecorino into tiles with a knife (irregular pieces are okay).\r\nAdd Pecorino, herbs, and oil to pickled shallots and toss gently to combine. Taste and season with more salt if needed; set aside.\r\nPrepare a grill for medium-high heat; clean grate. Working one at a time, set mushrooms on their sides and slice lengthwise ¼\" thick to make 3–4 planks per mushroom, depending their size. If your mushrooms are particularly small or you are using crimini, slice ½\" thick and thread onto skewers to keep them from falling through grate.\r\nUsing some of the oil, brush cut sides of mushrooms and transfer to a large bowl or arrange on a rimmed baking sheet if skewered. Lightly brush both sides of each slice of bread with remaining oil and transfer to a platter.\r\nPress each slice of bread down across grate for even contact and grill until browned with some lightly charred spots, about 2 minutes per side. The goal is a crunchy exterior with a still chewy center. Transfer bread back to platter.\r\nBrush grate to clean. If using a gas grill, turn heat down to medium. A charcoal grill should be at the tail end of medium-high and headed toward medium at this point, but wait a few minutes if needed. Grill mushrooms, turning halfway through and moving around as needed to avoid flare-ups, until golden all over with lightly charred edges, 6–8 minutes for small pieces and 8–10 minutes for large ones.

  "Instructions": "For the ribs, stir together the sugar, salt, smoked paprika, chili powder, regular paprika, onion powder, black pepper and thyme. Set aside.\r\nWith a small, sharp knife, release the edge of the membrane on the back of each rack of ribs. Grasp the edge with needle-nose pliers or a piece of paper towel and peel the membrane off the rack. (If you leave the membrane on, the ribs will be chewy.)\r\nSpread the dry rub all over each rack of ribs until completely coated. Make sure you press the dry rub into the meat. This is where your flavor is going to come from. Arrange the ribs in a rib rack, with all the racks facing the same direction. A rib rack has 8 slab compartments, looks like a rack of coat hangers and can be purchased at most barbecue stores.\r\nFire up your charcoal grill and prep the grill for cooking over indirect heat. You need a low temperature of around 250 to 300°F (120 to 150°C) to grill the ribs. For gas grills, preheat the grill to low then turn off one side of the grill to achieve indirect heat. Place a drip tray on the cooler side of the grate and half fill the pan with warm water or the beer of your choice.\r\nDrain 2 chunks of hickory, place them on top of the charcoal and set the grate in place. For gas barbecues, place half of the hickory chips in a foil pouch and place the pouch directly on the heated side of the grill. Wait for the hickory to start to smoke.\r\nPlace the rib racks over indirect heat as far from the heat as possible, with the bone sides facing toward the heat. Close the lid and close the top vent on a charcoal grill about halfway. This will maintain a temperature between 250 and 300°F (120 and 150°C). Cook the ribs for 2 hours.\r\nOnce the ribs are on, it’s time to start working on the barbecue sauce. If you have a side burner this can be done outside. If you don’t, go inside and use your stove top to simmer your sauce. Combine all the ingredients in a small saucepan set over medium heat. Simmer for 20 to 30 minutes or until the sauce reaches a glaze consistency. Remove the saucepan from the heat and set aside to cool.\r\nThe first batch of charcoal should be cooling down after 2 hours. Now is the time to use your chimney starter and get another batch of charcoal lit. Add the remaining wood chunks to the coals to get a little more smoke. If using a gas grill, wrap the remaining chips in foil and place directly on the hotter side of the grate. Close the lid and grill for another 2 hours. Make sure to come back every hour on the hour to check the temperature and to add more charcoal, if necessary. In the last hour of grilling, your ribs will start to show signs of cooking all the way through. When the meat pulls back from the bone, the ribs are almost ready. Baste the ribs with the barbecue sauce during the last 5 to 10 minutes of cooking. I like to tent my ribs before serving, so take them off the grill and let them rest, loosely covered with foil, for 10 minutes.",

  "Instructions": "To make the cake: Set the oven to 350°F and adjust the rack positions to the middle and top third. Spray three 8-inch round cake pans well with baking spray.\r\nSift the flour with the baking soda.\r\nIn a large bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the eggs well, then beat in the sugar, oil, and vinegar. On low speed, slowly add the flour and beat in well. Add the buttermilk slowly, then the vanilla, and then the food coloring.\r\nPour the batter evenly into the pans and rap them on the countertop several times to eliminate any air bubbles. Bake for 12 minutes, then rotate the pans from shelf to shelf so they bake evenly and bake until the tops spring back when lightly touched, about 25 minutes altogether. Let the cakes cool in the pans on racks for 15 minutes.\r\nRun a knife around the sides of the pans and invert the cakes onto the racks to cool completely. Once they’re cool, refrigerate the cakes for 20 to 30 minutes to make icing them easier.\r\nTo make the icing: Combine everything in a medium bowl and mix well until very smooth. It’s best to use the icing right away, when it’s soft and spreadable.\r\nPut one cake layer upside down on a cake plate or cake stand and cover the top evenly with frosting. Add a second layer, right side up, and spread with more frosting. Top with the third layer, right side up, and spread the frosting evenly around the sides of the cake and on top; check for any places where you can see through to the cake. Finally, sprinkle the pecans evenly all over the top of the cake.\r\nOnce the frosting sets, cut into slices to serve. This cake keeps for up to 2 weeks in a cake keeper, but once it’s ready, people want to dive right in.",

  "Instructions": "To make the strawberries, toss the coined berries and cane sugar together in a bowl. Let them sit for about 20 minutes, or until they start to break down and liquefy.\r\nPreheat the oven to 450°F (230°C or gas mark 8) and have a sheet pan lined with parchment nearby.\r\nTo make the biscuits, in a bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, granulated sugar and salt. Drizzle over the olive oil, and gently toss with your hands until droplets of oil are dispersed evenly throughout the flour. Add the buttermilk, stirring gently and compressing with your hands until a shaggy dough is formed. Dump out onto a floured work surface and knead until it comes together into a solid mass. Roll it out into a 1¼-inch (3-cm)-thick disk. Using a 3-inch (7.5-cm) biscuit cutter, punch out 6 biscuits, folding and re-rolling the dough if needed. Place the biscuits on the lined sheet tray, brush with more buttermilk, sprinkle with raw sugar if using, and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until slightly puffed and golden brown. Remove the biscuits and transfer to a wire rack to cool.\r\nTo make the balsamic glaze, combine the balsamic vinegar and honey in a saucepan and bring it to a simmer. Cook over medium-low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the liquid reduces by half. Set aside to cool and thicken.\r\nTo make the whipped cream topping, when you’re ready to serve, beat together the cream and honey in a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, or in a bowl with an electric mixer, until stiff peaks form, about 3 minutes. Split the cooled biscuits in half and spoon on some of the strawberries along with some of their juices so it soaks into the bottom biscuit. Top with a dollop of whipped cream, followed by a drizzle of the balsamic glaze. Top with the other half of the biscuit, and repeat with more strawberries, more cream, and another drizzle of glaze.

  "Ingredients": "['Scant 2 cups (230 g) all-purpose flour', '2½ tsp (11 g) baking powder', '3 tbsp (45 ml) milk', '2 tbsp (30 ml) elderflower cordial', '1 cup (225 g) unsalted butter', '1 cup plus 2 tbsp (230 g) superfine/caster sugar', 'Zest of 1 lemon', '4 eggs', 'Approximately 1 lb (400–450 g) fresh strawberries', '¼ cup (50 g) superfine/caster sugar', '2 tsp (10 g) vanilla bean paste', '½ cup plus 1 tbsp (150 g) egg whites', '1 cup (200 g) superfine/caster sugar', '1⅓ cups (300 g) unsalted butter, softened', '6 tbsp (90 ml) elderflower cordial', 'Fresh strawberries, to decorate', 'Fresh elderflower, to decorate']",
  "Instructions": "Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease the base and sides of three deep, round 6-inch (15-cm) cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper.\r\nTo make the cake, sift together the flour and baking powder in a large bowl, and set aside. Mix the milk and elderflower cordial in a small bowl and set aside. Using a stand mixer or electric whisk, beat the butter, sugar and lemon zest for 5 minutes, or until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. If the mixture looks like it’s starting to curdle, add 1 tablespoon (8 g) of the flour mixture. Turn the mixer speed to low and add half of the flour mixture followed by the milk and elderflower. Stir in the remaining flour and divide the batter equally into the prepared cake pans. Bake the cakes for 35 to 37 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in their pans for 10 minutes before turning them out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Once cool, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and place in the fridge to firm up.\r\nTo make the purée, preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Slice the stems off the strawberries, cut them in half and put them into a baking dish. Toss the fruit with the sugar and vanilla. Roast the strawberries in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, stirring once halfway. The strawberries are done once they are soft and fragrant and the juices have turned into a syrup. Leave the strawberries to cool completely before transferring them to a food processor or blender and pulsing until smooth. Store in an airtight container in the fridge until you’re ready to use it.\r\nTo make the buttercream, add the egg whites and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer or a heatproof bowl. Make sure there are no traces of grease in the bowl as this will stop the meringue from whipping up. Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, making sure that the base doesn’t touch the water. Whisk the eggs and sugar constantly until the mixture reaches a temperature of about 150°F (65°C). If you don’t have a thermometer, rub a little of the mixture in between your fingers. The eggs should be hot to the touch with all the sugar dissolved.\r\nRemove the bowl from the heat and start whisking the egg whites on high speed in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or with an electric whisk. Beat until the whites are thick and have doubled in volume. Once the bowl is cool to the touch and with the mixer still running, add the butter a piece at a time. The meringue will deflate and will start to look a little runny or curdled. Don’t panic—this is normal. Continue beating until you have added in all of the butter and the mixture is smooth and glossy. If after 10 minutes, your meringue buttercream is still soupy, chill it in the fridge for 20 minutes and then beat again. Add about 1/2 cup (125 g) of the strawberry puree and beat the buttercream for 2 minutes, or until smooth. Leave the buttercream at room temperature until you are ready to assemble.\r\nUnwrap the cakes from the fridge and if any of them are domed, level them with a serrated knife or a cake leveler. All the layers need to be completely flat to ensure you don’t end up with a wonky cake. Brush each cake layer with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of elderflower cordial. Place one layer of cake on a cake board and put this board on a turntable, if using. If your buttercream has firmed up, whip it up again in the mixer until smooth. Add a scoop of buttercream and spread it out evenly with an offset spatula, pushing the buttercream right to the edge (it’s fine if it spills over). Place the next layer on top of the first, but this time add about 1 tablespoon (8 g) of strawberry purée on top of the buttercream layer, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) clear around the edge. Place the last layer topside down to give you a perfectly flat top.\r\nFrost the top and sides of the cake with a thin layer of buttercream. Smooth the edges as much as you can with a bench scraper or palette knife. This is the crumb coat layer that will trap any stray crumbs and act as a base for the next layer. Place the cake in the fridge for 20 minutes to firm up before adding another layer of buttercream on the top and sides. Fill a piping bag fitted with an open star nozzle (I’ve used Wilton 8B) with any remaining buttercream and pipe swirls across the edge to make a wreath. Top the cake with fresh strawberries, a drizzle of any leftover puree and fresh elderflower (if in season).",

  "Instructions": "Stir together the flour, sugar, and salt, then add the cold butter and toss to combine. Use your fingers to rub the butter into the flour, pinching it between your thumbs and fingers until you’ve got a ragged mixture with irregular pieces of butter still intact, the largest about the size of an almond. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons of the ice water over the mixture and use a fork to quickly incorporate. Keep adding water by the ½ tablespoon until it appears just moistened—a dough that’s too wet will lead to a tough crust, so err on the side of it seeming a little dry. Dump the mixture onto a piece of plastic wrap. Working from the outside of the plastic, shape it into a flat disc. Wrap, then refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to overnight.\r\nPreheat the oven to 375°F.\r\nUsing the same bowl as for the crust, combine the fruit, 3 tablespoons of the sugar, and the salt. In a small bowl, stir together the flour and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.\r\nPlace the chilled dough on a lightly floured work surface and roll into a circle about 13 inches in diameter. Roll from the center, rotating 90 degrees after each roll, and adding a bit more flour as needed if the dough sticks. Drape the rolled dough over a rolling pin and transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Spread the flour-sugar mixture evenly over the dough, leaving a clean rim of about an inch, and pile the fruit on top. Fold the crust around over the fruit, pleating rustically as you go. Brush the exposed pastry with water, then sprinkle generously—over the crust and the fruit, too—with sugar. Transfer to the oven and bake until the fruit juices are bubbling in the center and the crust is golden, 50 to 60 minutes, or more depending on the fruit.\r\nServe warm, with fresh whipped cream or ice cream, or cold, perhaps for breakfast, with yogurt.",

Manchego cheese, coarsely grated', '4 oz. sliced pepperoni and/or thinly sliced soppressata (optional)', 'Rosemary Agrodolce (optional)', 'Basil leaves, torn if large, and crushed red pepper flakes (for serving; optional)']",
  "Instructions": "Stir yeast, sugar, and 1¼ cups warm (not hot) water in the bowl of a stand mixer until yeast dissolves. Let sit until mixture is foamy, about 5 minutes.\r\nAdd whole wheat flour, salt, and 2 Tbsp. oil to yeast mixture and mix to combine. Fit mixer with dough hook and, with mixer on low speed, gradually add 3 cups (375 g) bread flour, mixing until a shaggy dough forms, about 4 minutes from when you start adding the flour. Stop mixer and scrape down sides of bowl to incorporate any dry bits into dough. Increase mixer speed to medium and knead until dough is smooth and shiny, about 5 minutes.\r\nTransfer dough to a lightly floured surface and knead briefly to bring together. Shape into a ball, place in a large lightly oiled bowl, and turn to coat. Cover bowl and let dough sit in warm draft-free spot until doubled in size, 1–1½ hours. Make your toppings while your dough is rising.\r\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add tomatoes, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until skins start to blister and split, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and toss to coat. Cook, lightly pressing on tomatoes with spoon to release juices without smashing completely, until garlic is softened, about 2 minutes. Mix oregano into sauce; taste and season with more salt and pepper if needed.\r\nDo ahead: Sauce can be made 4 days ahead. Let cool, then cover and chill. Bring to room temperature and stir to combine before using.\r\nCut Swiss chard leaves away from ribs and stems, then cut crosswise into 3\"-wide strips. Trim away woody part from stems; discard. Finely chop ribs and stems.\r\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add ribs and stems and season with salt and black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until they release some liquid, look slightly shriveled, and are a shade or two darker, about 5 minutes. Add leaves and red pepper flakes and toss to coat. Season with more salt and black pepper and reduce heat to medium. Cook, tossing occasionally, until leaves are bright green, wilted, and tender, about 4 minutes. Transfer chard mixture to a medium bowl and let cool slightly.\r\nFinely grate garlic into bowl with chard mixture, then finely grate in zest from lemon; mix well. Add Parmesan and mix again to combine. Taste and season with more salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes, if needed.\r\nDo ahead: Chard mixture can be made 2 days ahead. Let cool, then cover and chill. Bring to room temperature and stir to combine before using.\r\nPurée tomatoes in a blender on low speed (or use an immersion blender if you have one) until smooth (try not to aerate it too much). Transfer sauce to a medium bowl and stir in oil and salt.\r\nDo ahead: Passata can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill, or freeze up to 6 months.\r\nPrepare a grill for medium-high indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off). Clean grate. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 4 pieces. Working one at a time, gently shape into balls. Transfer to a lightly floured small rimmed baking sheet and cover. Let sit 20–30 minutes.\r\nPlace a ball of dough on a lightly floured surface (keep remaining balls covered) and, using your fingers, press out to an 8\" round. Drape dough over the backs of your hands and gently pull and stretch, rotating dough as you go, until about 12\" in diameter (it’s okay if it’s not a perfect circle).\r\nBrush dough with oil. Place, oiled side down, on grill over direct heat and cook until large bubbles appear across surface, dough stiffens, and underside is dark brown, about 2 minutes. Brush top with oil, turn over, and cook just to lightly dry out second side, about 30 seconds.\r\nUsing tongs and a metal spatula, move dough over to cooler side of grill. Top with a spoonful of passata or burst cherry tomatoes and one quarter of cheese (either alone or in combination). Add pepperoni or salami (if using), then some of the lemony Swiss chard, and/or Rosemary Agrodolce as desired. Carefully slide pizza back over direct heat. Cook until cheese is melted and toppings are heated through, about 2 minutes. If dough is in danger of burning on underside but toppings need more time, return pizza to cooler side, cover grill, and cook another 1–2 minutes.\r\nTransfer pizza to a cutting board and drizzle with more oil. Top with basil and red pepper flakes if desired.\r\nRepeat with remaining ingredients to make 3 more pizzas.",

  "Instructions": "Season chicken all over inside and out with salt and pepper (make sure to get in and around every nook and cranny; about 4 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 2½ tsp. Morton kosher salt). Place on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet and let sit at room temperature while you make the garlic butter, or chill, uncovered, up to 1 day. If chilling, let sit at room temperature 1 hour before roasting.\r\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 325°F. Coarsely chop 4 green garlic stalks; transfer to a food processor. Pulse until very finely chopped. Add zest and butter and pulse until almost smooth. Cut remaining 4 green garlic stalks in half lengthwise; set aside.\r\nPat chicken dry again with paper towels (this will help the butter adhere and get the skin nicely browned). Smear garlic butter all over chicken. Gently lift the skin on the breast away from the flesh and rub some butter inside.\r\nToss reserved green garlic and oil in a large cast-iron skillet or 13x9\" baking dish to coat; season with salt. Tie chicken legs together with kitchen twine and tuck wings underneath back. Place chicken, breast side up, on top of garlic in skillet.\r\nRoast chicken, rotating pan halfway through for even browning, until skin is golden and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155°F (don’t worry; temperature will climb to 165°F as the chicken rests), 80–90 minutes. Let chicken rest at least 20 minutes and up to 45 minutes.\r\nTransfer chicken to a cutting board and carve as desired. Serve with roasted green garlic alongside.",

Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a medium bowl.\r\nScrape butter into a large bowl and add brown sugar and granulated sugar.

  "Instructions": "Combine buttermilk and 6 Tbsp. oil in a small microwave-safe bowl (it won’t get smooth and that’s okay) and heat in the microwave in three 10-second bursts until just about body temperature (it shouldn’t feel hot or cold to the touch); an instant-read thermometer will register about 98°F. (Alternatively, you can heat in a small saucepan over medium-low, stirring constantly, about 1 minute.)\r\nWhisk egg, brown sugar, and yeast in a liquid measuring cup to combine, then whisk into buttermilk mixture.\r\nPulse flour, baking soda, and salt in a food processor to combine. With the motor running, stream in buttermilk mixture. Process until about 80% of the dough comes together into a ball (mixture will look very wet at first, then begin to pull away from the sides of processor), about 2 minutes.\r\nUsing a bowl scraper or rubber spatula, scrape dough onto an unfloured surface. (It should still be pretty wet and sticky.) Knead, pushing it away from you, then pulling it back toward you, until a smooth ball forms, about 3 minutes. The dough will grow silkier, tighter, and easier to work with as you knead.\r\nRoll out dough into a rough 8\" square. Fold dough over onto itself to make an 8x4\" rectangle, then flatten it slightly and fold over once more to make a 4\" square. Roll dough back out to an 8\" square and repeat folding process (you should be back at a 4\" square). Pour remaining 1 Tbsp. oil into a medium bowl and add dough (still folded); turn to coat. Cover bowl tightly and chill dough until doubled in volume, at least 8 hours and up to 1 day.\r\nPlace dates in a small bowl and pour in 1½ cups hot water to cover. Let soak until softened, about 10 minutes.\r\nDrain dates and transfer to a food processor; discard soaking liquid. Add cinnamon, salt, and 2 Tbsp. oil. Purée, scraping down sides as needed, until smooth, about 4 minutes. (You should have about ½ cup purée.)\r\nGrease a 10\" cast-iron skillet with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil. Transfer dough to a clean, unfloured surface and roll out to an 8\" square. Fold in half into an 8x4\" rectangle, then fold rectangle over itself to form a 4\" square (same folding process as you did before). If dough feels tough and uncooperative, let it sit about 5 minutes to relax and try again. Roll out dough to a 12\" square about ¼\" thick. Dollop date purée all over. Using a small offset spatula, spread evenly over dough, leaving a ½\" border without purée along edge farthest from you. Sprinkle brown sugar over purée.\r\nStarting at edge closest to you, roll up dough into a tight log. Using a sharp serrated knife and long sawing motions, trim about ½\" of dough from both ends and discard. Slice log crosswise into 3 sections, wiping knife clean between slices. Slice each section crosswise into 3 buns (you should have 9 buns total that are each about 1\" thick). Transfer buns to prepared pan as you go.\r\nCover pan tightly with foil (or a domed lid if you have one) and place in a warm, dry spot. Let buns rise until they’re doubled in volume and spring back when poked, leaving only a small indentation, 1–1½ hours, depending on how warm and humid your kitchen is.\r\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°F. Bake buns, still covered, until puffed, pale, and mostly set, about 20 minutes. Remove foil and continue to bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes if you prefer a soft and squishy bun and up to 25 minutes for a more toasted bun. Let cool slightly.\r\nMeanwhile, whisk powdered sugar, buttermilk, and vanilla in a medium bowl to combine.\r\nBrush glaze over warm buns and serve in skillet.\r\nDo Ahead: Purée can be made 3 days ahead. Place in an airtight container; cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before using.",

  "Ingredients": "['1 (¼-oz.) envelope active dry yeast (about 2¼ tsp.)', '2 tsp. honey', '5 cups (625 g) all-purpose flour', '5 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 Tbsp. Morton kosher salt', '6 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more for hands', 'Flaky sea salt', '4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, plus more for pan', '2-4 garlic cloves']",
  "Instructions": "Whisk yeast, honey, and 2½ cups lukewarm water in a medium bowl and let sit 5 minutes. Add flour and salt; mix with a rubber spatula until a shaggy dough forms and no dry streaks remain.\r\nPour 4 Tbsp. oil into the biggest bowl that will fit in your refrigerator. Transfer dough to bowl and turn to coat in oil. Cover with a silicone lid or plastic wrap and chill until dough is doubled in size (it should look very bubbly and alive), at least 8 hours and up to 1 day.\r\nGenerously butter a 13x9\" baking pan (for thicker focaccia that’s perfect for sandwiches) or an 18x13\" rimmed baking sheet. Pour 1 Tbsp. oil into center of pan. Keeping the dough in the bowl, gather up edges of dough farthest from you and lift up and over into center of bowl. Give the bowl a quarter turn and repeat process. Do this 2 more times; you want to deflate dough while you form it into a rough ball. (Using a fork in each hand makes this process even easier and less messy!)\r\nTransfer dough to prepared pan. Pour any oil left in bowl over the dough and coat it in oil. Let rise, uncovered, in a dry, warm spot until doubled in size, at least 1½ hours and up to 4 hours. To see if it’s ready, poke the dough with your finger. The dough should spring back slowly, leaving a small visible indentation. If it springs back quickly, the dough isn’t ready. (If at this point the dough is ready to bake but you aren’t, you can chill it up to 1 hour.)\r\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 450°F. Lightly oil your hands. If using a rimmed baking sheet, gently stretch out dough to fill (you may not need to do this if using a baking pan). Dimple focaccia all over with your fingers, as if you’re aggressively playing the piano, creating very deep depressions in the dough. Drizzle with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil and sprinkle with sea salt. Bake focaccia until puffed and golden brown all over, 20–30 minutes.\r\nMelt 4 Tbsp. butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat and grate in garlic (use 2 cloves if you’re garlic-shy or up to 4 if you love it). Return to medium heat and cook, stirring often, until garlic is just lightly toasted, about 45 seconds. Brush garlic butter all over focaccia. If you don’t want to serve the focaccia immediately, hold off on brushing so it remains crisp.",

Let cool slightly.\r\nWhile the shortbread is cooling, heat brown sugar and butter, whisking constantly, in a heavy medium saucepan over medium until butter is melted and sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Whisk in cream and salt. Bring to a boil and cook, whisking constantly, until butterscotch is thick enough to coat a spoon (bubbling will become less frequent), about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, add tahini and vanilla and whisk until incorporated and smooth.\r\nPour butterscotch over shortbread and tilt pan to distribute evenly. Chill until set, 30–40 minutes.\r\nMelt chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave in 40-second increments, stirring between bursts. (Alternatively, place chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of gently simmering water; bowl should not touch water. Heat, stirring often, until melted and smooth.) Pour over butterscotch and spread evenly to edges of pan; sprinkle with sesame seeds. Chill until chocolate is firm, 1–2 hours.\r\nUsing parchment paper overhang, pull bars out of pan and set on a cutting board; remove parchment. Using a serrated knife, slice into 25–36 pieces (5–6 cuts in each direction). Bring to room temperature before serving.\r\nDo Ahead: Bars can be made 4 days ahead.

  "Instructions": "Adjust rack one-third up from the bottom of the oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Then, a little at a time, brush the orange juice/sugar mixture all over the cake; encourage most of it to run down the sides between the cake and the pan, but thoroughly wet the top also. The cake will absorb it all.\r\nLet the cake stand in the pan until it is completely cool. Then cover the pan loosely with a piece of wax paper.

The mixture will thicken into mayonnaise consistency (unless high-butterfat cream is used). Gradually beat in the sugar. It should take about 30 seconds to incorporate it.\r\nDetach the bowl and whisk beater from the stand. Add half the flour mixture to the cream mixture and, with the whisk attachment stir and fold in the flour until most of it disappears.

  "Ingredients": "['Vegetable oil (for pan)', '3 medium carrots, peeled', '1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into pieces', '1 cup (130 g) raw pistachios', '3 large eggs, room temperature', '1 cup (packed; 200 g) dark brown sugar', '¼ cup (50 g) granulated sugar', '1¾ tsp. baking powder', '¼ tsp. baking soda', '1½ tsp. ground cardamom', '½ tsp. ground cinnamon', '1¼ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt', '1½ cups (188 g) all-purpose flour', '½ cup carrot juice', '½ cup heavy cream', '½ cup (100 g) granulated sugar', '¼ tsp. kosher salt', '2 Tbsp. unsalted butter']",
  "Instructions": "Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°F. Lightly coat bottom and sides of a 9\"-diameter cake pan with oil. Line bottom of pan with a round of parchment paper and smooth to eliminate any air bubbles.\r\nGrate carrots on the large holes of a box grater. Measure out 2½ cups (lightly packed; 250 g); reserve remaining carrots for another use (like raita!).\r\nSet a fine-mesh sieve over a measuring glass and place next to stove. Heat butter in a medium saucepan over medium until foaming, about 2 minutes. Add pistachios and cook, stirring often, until butter browns and nuts smell toasty, about 5 minutes. (Butter will get very foamy and it will be hard to see what’s going on, so once the foam is golden brown, remove pan from heat every 10 seconds to check how the nuts are browning.) Pour mixture through prepared sieve, scraping in all of the browned bits; set nuts and butter aside.\r\nCrack eggs into a large bowl; add brown sugar, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cardamom, cinnamon, and salt. Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat 3 minutes (mixture should be thick, pale, and increased in volume). Decrease speed to medium-high and gradually stream in reserved brown butter (including browned bits); beat until combined. Coarsely chop reserved pistachios. Using a rubber spatula, fold in flour until almost completely combined, then add nuts and carrots and continue to fold until everything is incorporated. Scrape batter into prepared pan; smooth surface. Place pan on a clean smooth surface and give it a fast 360-degree spin (this pushes the batter up the sides of the pan and minimizes doming during baking).\r\nBake cake until deeply browned and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 50–55 minutes. Let cake cool in pan. Run a small offset spatula or butter knife around perimeter of cake to loosen. Place a plate upside down over cake and invert cake onto plate (leave flat side up). Remove parchment paper.\r\nDo Ahead: Cake can be baked 1 day ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.\r\nPlace a small plate in the freezer. Cook carrot juice, cream, granulated sugar, and salt in a small saucepan over high heat (do not stir) until thick like lava, 8–10 minutes. Mixture will initially bubble and foam vigorously and look like it’s going to boil over, but it won’t! Don’t be tempted to reduce the heat; the bubbling will subside and mixture will thicken. You want it to be thick enough to stick to the cake, but do not let it brown. Test glaze by putting a small dollop onto the cold plate: When you run your finger through the glaze, it should leave a defined trail.\r\nOnce the glaze is thick enough, remove pan from heat and stir in butter. Let cool until you can comfortably hold your finger in it (if it’s too hot, it will run right off the cake), about 15 minutes.\r\nStir glaze well and pour over center of cake, nudging to the edges with offset spatula or butter knife. Pop any air bubbles with a toothpick. Let glaze cool at least 10 minutes before slicing cake.",

Dough will be semifirm but can be rolled out without chilling. If your kitchen is very warm and/or dough is sticky, pat it into a 1\"-thick disk, wrap in plastic, and chill 15 minutes to let firm up before rolling out.\r\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°F. Roll out dough on a lightly floured sheet of parchment paper, dusting with more flour as needed to keep dough from sticking, to about ¼\" thick. Punch out shapes as desired with lightly floured cookie cutters and transfer to 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 1½\" apart. Pat scraps into a 1\"-thick disk, wrap with plastic, and chill 10 minutes if soft.\r\nBake 1 sheet of cookies, rotating halfway through, until edges are golden brown, 10–15 minutes. Let cookies cool 10 minutes on baking sheet, then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely. Bake remaining sheet of cookies, then repeat process with remaining dough.\r\nDo Ahead: Dough can be made 1 month ahead; wrap tightly and freeze. Cookies can be baked 2 days ahead; store airtight at room temperature.\r\nWhisk 1 cup powdered sugar, 3 Tbsp. milk, 2 tsp. food-coloring powder, and half of salt in a small bowl until no lumps remain. Glaze should be the consistency of heavy cream; add more milk if needed. For a deeper color, whisk in more powder 1 tsp. at a time until desired color is achieved; adjust with milk if needed. Repeat with second food-coloring powder, remaining salt, remaining 1 cup powdered sugar, and remaining 3 Tbsp. milk, adjusting intensity of color as desired.\r\nSpoon 1 tsp. first glaze in the center of a small plate. Drizzle 1 tsp. second glaze over the first and use a toothpick to slightly swirl colors together; don’t go overboard. (If you want to decorate larger cookies, add 1 tsp. glaze to plate for each additional inch.)\r\nGently press the top of a cookie into glaze, then lift up and allow excess glaze to drip back onto the plate. Using a toothpick, pop any air bubbles and swirl colors more if desired. Transfer to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with 2 more cookies, adding ½ tsp. of each color of glaze to plate before each cookie is dipped. The glaze will lose its swirly effect at this point. Clean plate and repeat process, decorating cookies in batches of 3 until all cookies have been glazed. Let sit until glaze is set, at least 2 hours.\r\nDo Ahead: Cookies can be glazed 1 day ahead.

Add dried fruit, chocolate, and toasted nuts and sesame seeds; mix with a wooden spoon until evenly distributed.\r\nDivide dough in half. Working one at a time, roll each piece into a 10\"-long log. Wrap each log tightly in plastic and roll across work surface to make as smooth and cylindrical as possible. Place on a rimmed baking sheet and freeze until surface is firm, about 20 minutes.\r\nSlap a log down onto counter to create a flat side; roll over and slap again to flatten another side (you’re aiming for a triangular shape). Repeat to create third side of the triangle. Tap against counter to smooth if needed, then tap ends to flatten. Repeat with second log. Return logs to baking sheet; freeze until firm, about 15 minutes.\r\nWorking one at a time, unwrap logs and brush sides with egg white. Working on baking sheet, sprinkle sides with remaining 1 cup sesame seeds and gently press to coat. Surface should be covered; use more sesame if needed. Freeze logs on baking sheet, uncovered, until surface is very firm but not frozen solid, about 1 hour.\r\nPreheat oven to 350°F. Slice a log crosswise into ¼\"-thick triangles and divide cookies between 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 1\" apart. (If dough is soft or starts to lose its shape, freeze 10 minutes before continuing.) Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and back to front halfway through, until edges are just set, about 10 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets. Transfer cookies to a platter or airtight container and line baking sheets with fresh sheets of parchment paper. Repeat process with remaining dough.\r\nDo Ahead: Dough can be rolled into logs 3 days ahead; refrigerate. Transfer to freezer 30 minutes before slicing. Cookies can be baked 1 day ahead; store airtight at room temperature.",

(or more) whole milk', 'Coarse white sanding sugar and edible glitter (for decorating)']",
  "Instructions": "Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°F. Toss pecans, maple syrup, and ½ tsp. salt in a medium bowl. Scrape onto a rimmed baking sheet lined with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper and spread nuts into a single layer. Bake until pecans are slightly darkened and syrup is dark and bubbling, 15–20 minutes. Remove from oven and carefully toss pecans in hot syrup to coat again. Let cool on baking sheet until caramel hardens, about 30 minutes. Break up candied pecans into pieces; discard any burned bits.\r\nReduce oven temperature to 325°F. Generously butter a 10\" cast-iron or stainless-steel skillet; line bottom with a round of parchment paper and butter parchment. Pulse flour, brown sugar, half of candied pecans, and 1¼ tsp. salt in a food processor until nuts are finely chopped. Add egg, 1 Tbsp. vanilla, and remaining 10 Tbsp. butter and process until a shaggy dough forms.\r\nTransfer dough to a large bowl and knead a couple of times just to bring it together. Using damp hands, pat dough evenly into skillet, extending all the way to the sides of the pan. Bake cookie until edges are golden brown and center is slightly puffed, 30–35 minutes. Let cool in skillet 1 hour. Invert cookie onto a cutting board and cut into 16 wedges. Turn right side up and transfer to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet.\r\nWhisk powdered sugar, milk, remaining ¼ tsp. salt, and remaining 1 tsp. vanilla in a small wide bowl until smooth. The glaze should be the consistency of heavy cream; thin with more milk if needed. Transfer half of the glaze to another small wide bowl (you’ll need to use 2 bowls as the glaze will start to collect crumbs and you’ll want a fresh start).\r\nWorking one at a time, lightly dip half of the wedges, top side down, into first bowl of glaze so that only the surface is covered and no glaze drips down the sides. Use a toothpick to pop any bubbles and smooth glaze; coating should be thin enough to see the cookie peeking through. Repeat with remaining wedges and second bowl of glaze.\r\nTop wedges with remaining candied pecans and let sit 10 minutes. Sprinkle with sanding sugar and glitter and let sit until glaze is set, about 1 hour.\r\nDo Ahead: Cookies can be baked 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.",

  "Instructions": "Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook, whisking occasionally, until mixture smells slightly nutty, about 3 minutes. Whisk in milk, then increase heat to medium-high, and still whisking constantly, bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook just until thick and no longer floury tasting, 8–10 minutes. Add Parmesan and whisk until melted, then whisk in cayenne and nutmeg; season with salt. Cover béchamel and keep warm until ready to use.\r\nDo Ahead: Béchamel can be made 3 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill. Reheat over medium-low, whisking constantly and adding a splash of water if needed to loosen.\r\nRemove ribs and stems from Swiss chard leaves and thinly slice. Tear leaves into large pieces. Combine oil and sausage with Swiss chard ribs and stems in a large skillet and set over medium-high heat. Cook, breaking up sausage with a heatproof rubber spatula or wooden spoon into small pieces, until sausage is almost cooked through, 5–7 minutes.\r\nAdd Swiss chard leaves to skillet a handful at a time, tossing and letting them wilt slightly between additions, until all the leaves have been added. Cook, reducing heat as needed (liquid should be bubbling slightly at this point), until liquid is almost completely evaporated (it’s important to dry out the Swiss chard here so the filling isn’t soggy), about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Let cool 5 minutes, then stir in ricotta. Season filling with salt.\r\nIf using pasta sheets, cook in a pot of boiling salted water 1 minute. Transfer to a large bowl of cold water. Lay out a row of pasta sheets on a rimmed baking sheet (don’t overlap), then top with a sheet of waxed or parchment paper. Repeat with remaining pasta sheets, placing sheets of paper between each layer.\r\nIf using shells, cook in a pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, just until very al dente, about 3 minutes less than package instructions; rinse under cold water to cool quickly.\r\nPreheat oven to 375°F. Spread half of béchamel into a 13x9\" baking dish. If using pasta sheets, lay out a sheet on a clean surface with a short end facing you. Spoon a heaping ¼-cupful of filling so it runs all the way down the center. Roll pasta around filling to create a 1 1/4\"-diameter tube (the pasta will overlap quite a bit). Repeat with remaining pasta sheets, arranging in baking dish as you go to create 2 rows. If using shells, spoon a heaping tablespoonful of filling into each shell and nestle next to each other to create rows (you’ll have about 5 rows of 6 shells each). Spread remaining béchamel over cannelloni, then marinara sauce. Top with Parmesan.\r\nBake cannelloni until edges of pasta are lightly browned and sauce is bubbling around edges of pan, 30–40 minutes.\r\nDo Ahead: Filling can be made 2 days ahead.

Mix the chicken well with the marinade, cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 24. The acidic marinade will start to break down the chicken, so if a more tender texture bothers you, marinate for 4 to 5 hours. I, however, am a fan of that texture and think an aggressively long, 24-hour marinade gives the chicken that much more flavor.\r\nHeat a grill until it is so hot you (almost) can’t look directly at it. Skewer the chicken; you can make a giant skewer to save space or lots of little ones for easier turning. Cook the skewered chicken, turning three times, until nicely charred, 5 to 7 minutes on each of the four sides. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes, then take it off the skewers.\r\nTo serve on the rolls, top with whichever of the following makes you the happiest: lettuce, tomatoes, onion, reserved marinade, pepperoncini, olives.

  "Instructions": "Position a rack in the center of your oven and preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper.\r\nIn a medium saucepan over low heat, melt the butter. Remove the pan from the heat and add ½ cup of the sugar and 2 tablespoons of water. Whisk the mixture until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is glossy and thickened a little. Pour the melted butter and sugar into the prepared cake pan and smooth into an even layer to cover the bottom. Place the cake pan in the freezer until the butter and sugar layer freezes; leave the pan in the freezer until you are ready to transfer the batter to the pan.\r\nIn a small bowl, gently toss the lemon slices with the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar. Leave the lemon slices in the sugar to macerate for 10 minutes.\r\nSift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a large bowl. Set aside. Combine the eggs with the olive oil in another large bowl and beat vigorously with a whisk until well combined. Add the yogurt and sugar. Make a well in the flour mixture and add the wet mixture in three additions, folding in each addition until no dry bits of flour remain. Set aside.\r\nFan the lemon slices out to cover the melted butter and sugar in the cake pan, overlapping the slices by as much as 1⁄8 inch. Pour the cake batter directly on top of the lemon slices.\r\nBake for about 1 hour, until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out with only a few moist crumbs clinging to it. Transfer to a wire cooling rack and let cool for 15 minutes. Invert the cake onto a serving plate and carefully remove the parchment-paper lining. Allow the cake to cool for 1 hour more before serving.\r\nNote: This cake can be made with nearly any citrus, my favorite being lemon because I like it to be bitter and tart. The only citrus I would not use is raw grapefruit, oro blanco, or lime. The rinds of grapefruit and oro blanco are much thicker than lemons and oranges and they will take longer to bake. Lime and grapefruit also retain too much of the bitter quinine flavor and will make for an odd-tasting cake",

  "Title": "Strawberry Honey Balsamic With Black Pepper Ice Cream",
  "Ingredients": "['10 ounces (about 1 pint) ripe strawberries, hulled and halved', '¼ cup honey', 'Heat the oven to 300°F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.', '½ cup granulated sugar', '2 tablespoons dry milk powder', '¼ teaspoon xanthan gum', '2 tablespoons light corn syrup', '1⅓ cups whole milk', '1⅓ cups heavy cream', '¾ cup Strawberry Puree (recipe follows), very cold', '¼ cup honey balsamic vinegar, like Honey Ridge Farms or O Olive Oil', '⅛ teaspoon freshly (and very finely) ground black pepper', '3 cups Ice Cream Base (recipe follows), very cold', '¾ cup your favorite strawberry jam']",
  "Instructions": "Spread the strawberries out evenly on the lined sheet pan and drizzle them with the honey. Bake for 15 minutes. Stir the berries and continue baking until they just barely begin to caramelize and get a little bit of roasted color to them, about 20 minutes more. Remove the sheet pan from the oven and let them sit until they’re cool enough to handle. Transfer the berries to a blender along with the yummy sticky stuff on the parchment paper and puree to make a smooth sauce. Chill in the fridge until cold.\r\nStore the puree in the fridge for up to 2 weeks or in the freezer for up to 3 months.\r\nCombine the sugar, dry milk, and xanthan gum in a small bowl and stir well.\r\nPour the corn syrup into a medium pot and stir in the whole milk. Add the sugar mixture and immediately whisk vigorously until smooth. Set the pot over medium heat and cook, stirring often and adjusting the heat if necessary to prevent a simmer, until the sugar has fully dissolved, about 3 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat.\r\nAdd the cream and whisk until fully combined. Transfer the mixture to an airtight container and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 6 hours, or for even better texture and flavor, 24 hours. Stir the base back together if it separates during the resting time. The base can be further stored in the fridge for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 3 months. (Just be sure to fully thaw the frozen base before using it.)\r\nIn a bowl, combine the strawberry puree, vinegar, and black pepper with the ice cream base. Whisk as needed to get everything completely incorporated into the base. Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and turn on the machine. Churn just until it has the texture of soft-serve.\r\nStir the jam with a fork to loosen it. Quickly alternate spooning layers of the mixture and dollops of the jam in freezer-friendly containers.\r\nCover with parchment paper, pressing it to the surface of the ice cream so it adheres, then cover with a lid. It’s okay if the parchment hangs over the rim. Store it in the coldest part of your freezer (farthest from the door) until firm, at least 6 hours. It will keep for up to 3 months.",

  "Title": "Beet Tostadas With Fried Eggs",
  "Ingredients": "['1½ lb. red beets (about 2 large), peeled, cut into (¼\") pieces', '2 garlic cloves, finely grated', '2 Tbsp. ancho chile powder', '1 tsp. crushed dried oregano, preferably Mexican', '1 tsp. paprika', '¾ tsp. ground cumin', '½ tsp. freshly ground black pepper', '1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1½ tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus more', '2⅓ cups plus 3 Tbsp. vegetable oil, divided', '1 large white onion, halved through root end, sliced (¼\" thick)', '6 medium serrano chiles, quartered lengthwise, leaving stems and seeds intact', '⅓ cup sage leaves', '6 (6\"-diameter) corn tortillas', '6 large eggs', 'Salsa de Árbol (for serving)']",
  "Instructions": "Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°F. Toss beets, garlic, chile powder, oregano, paprika, cumin, pepper, 1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1½ tsp. Morton kosher salt, and ⅓ cup oil in a medium bowl until beets are coated. Scrape onto a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet; bake, tossing every 15 minutes, until beets are tender and spices are very fragrant and smell slightly toasted, 35–45 minutes.\r\nMeanwhile, heat 2 cups oil in a large saucepan over high until oil bubbles immediately when the edge of a tortilla touches the surface. Carefully fry onion, adding a little bit at time to avoid too much spattering and reducing heat as needed, until tender and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet. Repeat process with chiles, about 5 minutes. Transfer to same baking sheet. Fry sage leaves until crisp, about 30 seconds. Transfer to baking sheet. Working one at a time, fry tortillas, turning once, until crisp, puffed in places, and deep golden brown, about 1 minute per side. Transfer tostadas to baking sheet.\r\nHeat remaining 3 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Crack eggs into skillet, leaving space around each one, and cook until whites are set and edges are crisp, about 4 minutes. Season with salt.\r\nSpoon beet mixture onto tostadas, dividing evenly, and top each with an egg, then fried onion, chiles, sage, and Salsa de Árbol.",
